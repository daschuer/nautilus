2000-10-18  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	added a Services menu, per Darin's advice, as a separate bonobo
	ui component.  Right now, it's leaking the UI handler, and the
	menu uris aren't correct; will finish this tomorrow.
	
	* src/Makefile.am:
	added new files: nemo-service-ui.xml and
	nemo_window_install_service_menu	
	
	* src/nemo-service-ui.xml:
	xml file defining service menu and toolbar button
	
	* src/nemo-shell-ui.xml:
	added placeholder for services menu and toolbar button; removed
	definition of toolbar button
	
	* src/nemo-window-private.h:
	added reference to install routine
		
	* src/nemo-window-service-menu.c: (goto_services_summary),
	(goto_online_storage), (goto_software_catalog),

	to avoid dereferencing it later.

2000-10-17  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c: (icon_free),
	(stop_rubberbanding), (destroy): Oops. Canvas items are not
	widgets, although they ref. count in a similar way.

2000-10-17  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/hardware/nemo-hardware-view.c:

2000-10-17  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3828 (switching views makes torn-off menus disappear)
	Fixed bug 3822 (Edit menu flashes when you click in location field)
	Fixed bug 3529 (menu bar flashes when view switched)

	These were all caused by our Bonobo xml files redefining labels
	for submenus, causing Bonobo to think that it needed to destroy
	the widget holding the title of the old submenu.

	* libnemo/nemo-clipboard-ui.xml:
	* src/file-manager/nemo-directory-view-ui.xml:
	* src/file-manager/nemo-icon-view-ui.xml:
	* src/file-manager/nemo-search-list-view-ui.xml:
	Removed all _label="Foo"s from submenus defined in
	nemo-shell-ui.xml (e.g. File, Edit, View).

	Some bug fixes and cleanup in the summary view code. I noticed a
	couple of obvious problems when I was trying to use services
	earlier, and they led me to fix up a little of this code.

	* components/services/summary/nemo-view/nemo-summary-view.c:
	Removed "feedback_text" field from Details struct; now it's just a
	parameter to generate_error_dialog (it was being leaked with each
	use, also).
	(generate_summary_form): Use new error_dialog_shown boolean to avoid
	showing exactly the same dialog twice; removed a bunch of duplicate 
	code by collapsing an if/else into only the part that's different;
	pass dialog text to generate_error_dialog directly
	(authn_cb_failed): Don't follow an exclamation point with a period.
	(generate_error_dialog): Set up a parent window so the dialog
	appears in a sensible place; use GNOME_STOCK_BUTTON_CANCEL instead
	of "CANCEL"; get message from parameter instead of Details field;
	change "Retry" to "Try Again" to be less nerdly.

	if it's cancelled.
	(metafile_read_try_public_metafile), (metafile_read_restart):
	Changed the old metafile_read_start function's name to
	metafile_read_restart since it's used on the second try.
	(is_anyone_waiting_for_metafile), (metafile_read_start): Move the
	logic about whether to start reading into this function to make it
	more like the other jobs. Also start the async. job.
	(file_list_cancel): Changed name for consistency and end the
	async. job.
	(directory_count_callback): End the async. job.
	(start_monitoring_file_list): Start the async job.
	(file_list_start): Moved logic about when to start loading the file
	list into this function to make it more like other jobs.
	(directory_count_start): Renamed to make it more like other jobs
	and start the async. job.
	(deep_count_callback): End the async. job.
	(deep_count_start): Start the async. job.

	(nemo_directory_cancel): Moved the cancelling code down here,
	remove a directory from the waiting list when it goes, and also
	wake up directories that may have breathing room from all the
	cancellation.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-private.h: Remove
	request_read_metafile from the header.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory.c:
	(nemo_directory_destroy): Eliminate the call to

	got_*_mime_type variables since they are the same as *_mime_type
	!= NULL.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c: (destroy): Get rid of
	checks for NULL before calling g_free.
	(nemo_file_update_info): Replace == FALSE with !. Simplified

2000-10-17  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3716, Bonobo paths for applications and
	viewers must be unique.

	Added unique index to bonobo path name.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:

2000-10-17  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Made "this application can only handle local files"
	dialog be parented on the NemoWindow from whence
	it came.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-program-choosing.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-program-choosing.c:
	(nemo_launch_application_parented): Removed this function
	(nemo_launch_application): Made this function take a
	parent (can be NULL, but better not to be).

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_launch_application): Remove "_parented"
	
	* src/nemo-sidebar.c: 
	(nemo_sidebar_get_window): New helper function to get
	enclosing window.
	(command_button_callback),
	(nemo_sidebar_chose_application_callback): Pass parent
	window to nemo_launch_application.

2000-10-17  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_constructed),
	(nemo_window_set_content_view_widget):
	fixed bug 3411, the sidebar resizes itself when viewing the
	summary page, by setting the "shrink" boolean to true
	when adding the content view container to the splitter.
	
2000-10-17  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3824 (Files in search list have unknown type)

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_get_type_as_string): Made this check cached
	slow_mime_type as well as cached default_mime_type. I'm worried
	about this whole area -- why did we differentiate the two? I'll
	bet there are other lurking bugs around here.

2000-10-17  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3825 (Bonobo error messages viewing search results)
	Fixed bug 3826 ("Reveal in New Window" misplaced in context menu)

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(append_selection_menu_subtree): take an identifier, store
	it in menu item for later identification, just like other menu
	items. This will all change when we switch to using Bonobo for
	context menus.
	(fm_directory_view_real_create_selection_context_menu_items):
	Pass the identifier that list view code was expecting to find.
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	fixed typo in COMMAND_REVEAL_IN_NEW_WINDOW #define. Those darn
	typos are deadly with new Bonobo.

2000-10-17  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-operations.c:
	(get_next_duplicate_name):
	Part of fix to but 2840 - URI parsing works wrong for URIs with 
	# characters. I noticed duplicating and creating links to files 
	with funny characters like # was broken and added proper escaping
	code to fix it.

2000-10-17  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.h:

	Fix missing param in prune_packages.  Make categorydata_list_copy

	* nemo-installer/src/installer.h:
	* nemo-installer/src/link.sh:

	Further attempts at recovering from a common error case (where the
	user ought to upgrade gnumeric too).  Fix up some of the text to
	match biz requirements.  Make a copy of the category list before
	doing the install-lib call, so that it doesn't munge our pristine
	list for the cases where we want to try again later.

2000-10-17  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/music/nemo-music-view.c:
	(nemo_music_view_initialize), (ensure_uri_is_image),
	(set_album_cover), (dialog_destroy), (set_image_button_callback),
	(nemo_music_view_set_album_image):
	for bug 2261, added a "set cover image" button to the music view,
	which is visible when there's no cover, which displays a file
	selector, and set the metadata when the user selects a valid image.
	This is almost complete, but it's not quite working yet.
	
	* src/nemo-shell.c: (display_caveat):
	increased the font size of the caveat to 14pt, since it was
	a little too hard to read and there was plenty of space.
	
2000-10-16  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (fm_icon_view_update_menus):
	fixed occasional segfaults from fm_icon_view_update_menus
	being called from idle after they've been destroyed; fixed by
	exiting if the menus_ready boolean is clear.
	
	* components/music/nemo-music-view.c:
	(nemo_music_view_set_album_image), (metadata_callback),
	(nemo_music_view_update_from_uri):
	fixed bug 3720, music view asks for album cover metadata incorrectly.
	Fixed by doing it correctly, using nemo_file_call_when_ready.
	This also partially fixes bug 2261, but it's still too hidden, so
	I won't close it out until we have an explicit way to do it.
	
2000-10-17  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	fix "do nothing" part of bug 3640
	* components/tree/nemo-tree-view.c: move 
	re-init of code from drag_leave to drag_begin.

2000-10-16  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (fm_icon_view_destroy):
	fixed a problem where we generated a zillion bonobo criticals
	when the view changed. The problem was that the fm-icon-view
	was trying to update the layout menus while it was being destroyed,
	after the menus were already gone.  The fix is clearing the
	"menus_ready" boolean at the start of the destroy method.
	 
2000-10-16  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* nemo.spec.in:
	Reverting change to check >= vs = issue.

2000-10-16  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* nemo.spec.in:
	Changed the dep of nemo-maozilla to mozilla = M18 instead of
	mozilla-M18. I can't put in >= M18, because rpm's fucks up on
	alphachar versions.

2000-10-16  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	leak.

2000-10-16  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3789 (Zoom In/Zoom Out/Back/Forward have lost

2000-10-16  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

        in non-Eazel-service build)

	* src/nemo-window-toolbars.c:
	(nemo_window_initialize_toolbars): Call set_hidden on
	the command, not the widget. We were waiting for a Bonobo
	fix to make this change, because it didn't work last time
	we tried. But now it does, so the Bonobo fix must have
	occurred.

	(nemo_clist_get_first_selected_row),

	Now that NemoList derives from NemoCList instead of GtkCList,
	do not call `nemo_gtk_clist_get_first_selected_row' or
	`nemo_gtk_clist_get_last_selected_row'.
	Instead add implementation using NemoCList instead of GtkCList.
	This fixes a bug where up/down/pgup/pgdown keys did not work properly
	when viewing directory as list.
	(nemo_list_get_first_selected_row):
	To avoid code duplication, replace the body of this function
	with a call to `nemo_clist_get_first_selected_row'.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c:

	* src/nemo-window-menus.c: 
	tweaked the names of a couple of #defines
	(refresh_bookmarks_menu): Added parameter check.

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c: (stop_loading),

	tell views to stop loading. Fixes bug 2939 (NemoView stop call
	never made when stop button pressed).

2000-10-12  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

 	Fixed two bugs that got in Pavel's and my way as we were testing
	our bug fixes.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory.c:
	(nemo_directory_notify_files_removed): Fix bug where it won't
	update the directory count if there is no NemoFile object
	already existing for the file.
	(nemo_directory_notify_files_moved): Mark any overwritten file
	as "gone" instead of just having two non-gone NemoFile objects
	with the same URI.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.h:
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_destroy), (fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize),
	(mount_unmount_removable): Got rid of code that acted like the
	volume monitor belonged to it. The main problem was destroying it,
	which is wrong in any case (at most you'd unref it, but even that
	is illegal since nemo_volume_monitor_get doesn't return a
	ref).
	
2000-10-12  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/music/nemo-music-view.c:
	(nemo_music_view_update_from_uri): Add a FIXME.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-async.c:
	(is_tentative), (get_non_tentative_file_list),
	(nemo_directory_monitor_add_internal), (ready_callback_call):
	Change callbacks so they won't redundantly report files that
	haven't really been discovered to exist.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_destroy): Fixed NemoFile leak by adding an
	unref of "directory_as_file".
	(file_list_from_uri_list), (selection_changed_callback),
	(display_pending_files): Simplified some selection-related code.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_real_merge_menus): Use DATADIR instead of
	NEMO_DATADIR, since that's where the UI XML files are. Not
	sure why this wasn't checked in last time.
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_constructed): Use
	DATADIR instead of NEMO_DATADIR, since that's where the UI XML
	files are. Not sure why this wasn't checked in last time.
	
	* src/nemo-main.c: (main): Add more domains to the list of the
	ones that are fatal. Maybe we can somehow use --g-fatal-warnings
	instead some day, but that makes the warnings core dump, and we
	like to be able to continue.
	
	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_begin_location_change): Removed the misguided
	event loop from here. It could only cause problems and contained
	no motivating comment explaining why it's a good idea.

2000-10-12  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/login/nemo-view/nemo-login-view.oafinfo:

2000-10-12  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3718 ("Open With" submenu enabled when it shouldn't be)

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(selection_contains_one_item_in_menu_callback),
	(selection_not_empty_in_menu_callback): Improved error messages.
	(open_with_other_program): Used selection_contains_one_item_
	in_menu_callback to avoid crash if menu state doesn't match
	expectations.
	(reset_bonobo_open_with_menu): Sensitize the "Open With" submenu
	appropriately.

	(nemo_icon_container_position_shadow),
	(auto_scroll_timeout_callback), (handle_local_move):
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-private.h:
	Fix a bug where the drag&drop selection shadow would sometimes
	run away from the dragged icons. This is kind-of related to 3406
	that I fixed earlier today. The problem happened when
	an autoscroll didn't actually happen because the adjustment
	values got clamped but the adjustment delta did get applied to
	the initial cached drag start location.
	Made nemo_icon_container_scroll return a boolean determining
	if a scroll actually happened.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory.c:
	(nemo_directory_notify_files_removed,
	nemo_directory_notify_files_moved): Use
	`nemo_file_get_existing', not `nemo_file_get', to check if
	a file is already known. `nemo_file_get' would have created
	new NemoFiles and NemoDirectories only to do redundant
	notification later in the function. Also, the old code was a bit

	* po/XMLFILES.in: Added a bunch of XML files that will one-day

	the toggle state using the command rather than the menu item.

	than for Find menu item to work around bug 3590.

	Also, protect the eazel services hacks with EAZEL_SERVICES #ifdefs.

	There's a crashing bug involving merged tool bar buttons 
	(bug 3574), so I didn't put the tool bar button back in Mozilla,

2000-10-09  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Bunches o' Bonobo conversion & cleanup. Most of this is
	about the new "command/widget separation" in Bonobo.
	Essentially, changes to sensitivity, state, and hiddenness
	should be made to the command (verb), whereas other changes
	should be made to the widget.

	This should fix the "cmd/widget" warnings at launch, and
	make the tool bar buttons desensitize appropriately again.

2000-10-09  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Various bonobo-related cleanups

	* components/loser/sidebar/nemo-sidebar-loser-ui.xml:
	* components/loser/sidebar/nemo-sidebar-loser.c:
	(bonobo_loser_callback), (loser_merge_bonobo_items_callback):
	* components/mozilla/nemo-mozilla-content-view.c:
	(bonobo_mozilla_callback), (mozilla_merge_bonobo_items_callback):
	* components/mozilla/nemo-mozilla-ui.xml:
	* components/sample/nemo-sample-content-view-ui.xml:
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_real_merge_menus):
	Modernized Bonobo use in these three components. There is a
	crashing bug when leaving a component that installs a tool bar
	button, so I did not install a tool bar button into Mozilla yet.
	Also, some of the callbacks don't work, so I haven't marked the 
	relevant bugs FIXED yet. I wanted to check in what I had so far;
	I'll get back to this a little later today.
	
	* src/nemo-shell-ui.xml:
	Removed "Menu_" from pixnames, to match new bonobo API; replaced
	<menuitem/> and <toolitem/> with <separator/>; added a placeholder
	into which components should install extra toolbar buttons; defined
	the services button here again (in this placeholder) -- it's before
	the throbber again.
	
	* src/nemo-window-menus.c: (nemo_window_initialize_menus):
	Added clarifying white space.
	
	* src/nemo-window-toolbars.c: 
	removed toolbar_services_callback, which is handled elsewhere.
	(set_up_button): Made this take button path instead of just name,
	so it can work with buttons in placeholders (like the Services button).
	(set_up_toolbar_images): Pass whole paths instead of just names.
	(nemo_window_initialize_toolbars): Set hidden attribute on
	Services button as appropriate, rather than creating it here from raw
	XML in the opposite case.

2000-10-08  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed bug 3549, services button disappeared due to UI handler
	change, by adding it on the fly if EAZEL_SERVICES is set.  Currently,
	it comes after the throbber, but that will be fixed when the
	throbber is positioned properly again.
	
	* src/nemo-window-menus.c: (stop_button_callback),
	(services_button_callback), (nemo_window_initialize_menus):
	added bonobo verb for services and it's handler.  Also, added one
	for the stop button, which was inadvertently lost during the
	translation.
	
	* src/nemo-window-toolbars.c: (set_up_toolbar_images),
	(nemo_window_initialize_toolbars):
	if EAZEL_SERVICES is set, add the services button and handle it's
	image.
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	* icons/Services.png:
	added Services image to default theme.
	
2000-10-08  Josh Barrow  <josh@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-shell-ui.xml:
	Change the "Ski" user level to "User Level", per Arlo suggestion 
	in bug 3497.

2000-10-08  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/rpmview/nemo-rpm-view-install.c:
	(get_detailed_errors_foreach),
	(nemo_rpm_view_dependency_check):
	Updated for the extra package status field.
	
	* components/services/install/command-line/eazel-alt-install-corba.
	c: (set_parameters_from_command_line), (tree_helper), (dep_check):
	Code to set the ssl_rename flag.
	Better output for dep_check (uses provides).
	
	* components/services/install/idl/trilobite-eazel-install.idl:
	Added the ssl_rename field and the WOULD_BE_LOST package status.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-corba-types.c:
	(corba_string_sequence_to_glist),
	(g_list_to_corba_string_sequence),
	(corba_packagedatastruct_from_packagedata),
	(packagedata_from_corba_packagedatastruct):
	Fixed 3460, transfers package->provides now.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-corba.c:

	Fixed indentation and cut'n'paste typeerror. Plus added the
	ssl_rename field.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-object.c:
	(eazel_install_emit_dependency_check_default):
	Removed the hack since 3460 is fixed.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-private.h:
	Added the ssl_rename field.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-protocols.c:
	(gnome_vfs_fetch_remote_file), 
	Do the ssl_renaming. If ssl_rename is set, the hostname in the
	source uri is replaced with "localhost". This allows you to use
	ssh tunneling to use development services from home.
	(eazel_install_fetch_package),
	Fixed bug 2584. Checks version and name of downloaded
	package. Uses rpmvercmp.
	(get_search_url_for_package):
	s/flag/flags/
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-public.h:
	ssl_rename functions.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-rpm-glue.c:
	(eazel_install_do_transaction_all_files_check),
	(eazel_install_start_transaction),
	Partially fixed 3460. I need to fail packages that do not pass.
	(eazel_install_requirement_dep_compare),
	(eazel_install_check_existing_packages),
	(eazel_install_fetch_dependencies),
	Fixed the weird case eli & robey came across, were the faulty
	nemo dependencies caused gconf 0.8 to be installed over 0.9
	which is still needed.
	Now the package which is installed gets the WOULD_BE_LOST status
	and install_failed emittet.
	(eazel_install_do_file_conflict_check),
	Removed comments.
	(eazel_install_ensure_deps), 
	Added more comments and fixed the removal of failedpackages after
	do_dependency_check.
	
	(eazel_uninstall_upward_traverse):
	Fixed an uninstall bug I came acrosss.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.c:
	(packagedata_status_enum_to_str),
	(packagedata_status_str_to_enum):
	Handles the WOULD_BE_LOST enum.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.h:
	The WOULD_BE_LOST enum
	
	* nemo-installer/src/Makefile:
	* nemo-installer/src/installer.c: (eazel_install_progress),
	(eazel_download_progress), (get_detailed_errors_foreach),
	(eazel_installer_add_category):
	Fixed output.

2000-10-08  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nemo-view/nemo-summary-view.c
	:

	Fixing debug code I added to force error dialog. whoops.

2000-10-08  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nemo-view/nemo-summary-view.c
	: (generate_summary_form), (authn_cb_failed), (goto_update_cb),
	(error_dialog_retry_cb), (error_dialog_cancel_cb),
	(generate_error_dialog):

	Added dialog to catch errors like unable to connect and login failed.
	Doesn't look great yet but Arlo is going to give me some ideas to
	make it look a bit better.

2000-10-07  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-theme.c:
	(nemo_theme_get_image_path_from_theme),
	(nemo_theme_get_image_path):
	re-organized the code to add the ability to request image
	paths from specific themes, as well as the current one.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-theme.h:
	added nemo_theme_get_image_path_from_theme.

	* src/nemo-sidebar-tabs.c:
	(nemo_sidebar_tabs_load_theme_data):
	used the above to implement sidebar tab redirection, so a theme
	can use the sidebar tabs from another theme, so sidebar tab images
	don't have to be present in every theme.
		
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c:
	(nemo_icon_factory_destroy), (check_local_theme), (set_theme),
	(get_icon_file_path):
	implemented icon theme default redirection, so a theme can specify
	another theme to get its icons from when they're not present locally;
	this is needed by both Arlo and Susan's themes.
	
	* src/nemo-throbber.c,h: (nemo_throbber_initialize_class),
	(nemo_throbber_button_press_event):
	made clicking on the throbber take you to a URL specified by
	the current theme.  Did this by adding a location_change signal. This
	fixes bug 3433.
	
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_constructed):
	hooked up nemo-window to the throbber's location_change signal to
	change the location when the signal is emitted.
	
	* icons/default.xml:
	added default URI for throbber, pointing to www.eazel.com
	* icons/vector/vector.xml:
	added sidebar tab redirection to the Arlo theme for testing

2000-10-07  Mike Fleming  <mfleming@eazel.com>

	* components/mozilla/main.c: (main):
	* components/mozilla/mozilla-events.cpp:
	* components/mozilla/mozilla-events.h:
	* components/mozilla/nemo-mozilla-content-view.c:
	(mozilla_uris_differ_only_by_fragment_identifier),
	(mozilla_progress_callback), (mozilla_dom_mouse_click_callback):

	Support POST-based form submissions in embedded mozilla
	(bugzilla.eazel.com 3484).  With this change, navigations involving
	POST's aren't forwarded to Nemo, they are handled inside Mozilla
	directly.  This means that the URI won't change and the navigation won't
	be logged in the history buffer, but its better than nothing.

	Note that this fix only works when using Mozilla M18.

	Note that there seem to be some general bumps with web-browsing with
	both M17 and M18 right now.

2000-10-07  Pavel Cisler <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_list_unref):
	Ooops, need to use nemo_g_list_save_for_each in the
	list unref call.

2000-10-07  Pavel Cisler <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-async.c:
	(dequeue_pending_idle_callback):
	Add a FIXME to some unclear or wrong code.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory.c:
	(nemo_directory_notify_files_added),
	(nemo_directory_notify_files_removed),
	(nemo_directory_notify_files_moved):
	Fix 3050 - Memory trashing during drag&drop.
	Files removed from monitored directories did get an
	unref but they didn't get a ref when added to new
	monitored directories.s
	Add FIXMEs to some unclear, wrong or missing code.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_new_from_name), (nemo_file_new_from_info),
	(nemo_file_ref), (nemo_file_unref):
	Add debugging code to help find ref-counting bugs with
	NemoFile. Sadly this is not the full ref/unref balance
	debugger I had originally in mind as it seems to be way harder 
	to match up refs/unrefs than I thought.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_list_ref), (nemo_file_list_unref),
	(nemo_file_list_free), (nemo_file_list_copy):
	Make these files call nemo_file_ref/nemo_file_unref
	instead of gtk_object_ref/gtk_object_unref. We should either
	stick to using nemo_file_ref/unref or get rid of them. 
	Using both pairs of calls is a mess.
	
2000-10-07  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-shell-ui.xml:
	made the "find" button be a toggle button like it's supposed to be.
	
2000-10-07  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-window-toolbars.c: (set_up_button),
	(set_up_toolbar_images), (set_up_throbber_frame_type):
	made themed toolbar buttons work properly with new UI handler;
	you must get a new Bonobo for it to work.  Also, made the
	"Search Web" button get the right image, and other clean-ups.
	
	* src/nemo-shell-ui.xml:
	made toolbar button separators work properly.  Also, removed
	"Service" button from xml file since it can't be conditionally
	added from there.
	
2000-10-06  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3517 (Sample component's merged items don't appear)
	
	* components/sample/nemo-sample-content-view-ui.xml:
	Filled in.
	* components/sample/nemo-sample-content-view.c:
	(bonobo_sample_callback), (sample_merge_bonobo_items_callback):
	Updated for new API, removed #ifdefs.

	* components/mozilla/nemo-mozilla-content-view.c:
	(mozilla_merge_bonobo_items_callback): Removed unnecessary cast.
	
2000-10-06  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	tried to put the right themable icons for the toolbar, but only
	succeeded at getting the stock icons.  Also, made the throbber
	show up, but it's not properly positioned yet.
	
	* src/nemo-shell-ui.xml:
	added stock icons and control for throbber
	
	* src/nemo-window-toolbars.c: (set_up_button),
	(set_up_toolbar_images), (set_up_throbber_frame_type),
	(allocate_throbber), (nemo_window_initialize_toolbars):
	revamped for the new bonobo, and tell the ui handler about the
	themed icons (temporarily disabled for now)
	
	* src/nemo-window.c: (navigation_bar_mode_changed_callback),
	(nemo_window_constructed):
	initialize the toolbar
	
	* src/nemo-window.h:
	removed the button fields, since they're now referenced through
	bonobo
	
2000-10-06  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3512 (Some separators not appearing in the
	right place)

	* src/nemo-shell-ui.xml: Reworked the separators and
	"delimit" properties of placeholders. All values other
	than 'delimit="top"' have been deprecated in Bonobo to
	try to gain some performance, so I only used that.
	
	* src/nemo-window-private.h: Updated Zoom menu paths
	that changed because I put in a new placeholder.
	* src/nemo-window.c:
	(nemo_window_zoom_level_changed_callback):
	This code wasn't updating the sensitivity of "Zoom Normal"
	at all. Now it's always sensitive for any zoom-supporting
	view. (There's a separate bug about how it should only be
	sensitive when not at the "Normal" setting, which I ignored
	for now).

2000-10-06  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Oops, one more change from previous checkin (breaks build
	without it)

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	Added missing include for nemo-bonobo-extensions.h
	
2000-10-06  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 3125. new bonbo ui handler.

	(nemo_bonobo_set_hidden), (nemo_bonobo_get_hidden):
	add new functions.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-bonobo-extensions.h:
	add prototypes.
	* src/nemo-window-menus.c:
	(nemo_window_update_show_hide_menu_items):
	switch to new bonobo code to hide/show toolbars. change menu 
	paths too.
	* src/nemo-window-private.h: change menu paths.
	* src/nemo-window.c: (show_dock_item), (hide_dock_item),

	(nemo_window_status_bar_showing):
	switch to new bonobo code for toolbar hiding/showing

2000-10-06  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Finished bug 3496 (labels in menu items never change)
	Finished bug 3495 (menu item sensitivity never changes)

	I think I have fixed all outstanding code that was setting
	the sensitivity and label text of menu items, except for
	cut/copy/paste (which is commented out) and undo, which
	has its own bug report. If you run across any others, 
	please write up new bugs.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: 
	(insert_bonobo_menu_item),
	(insert_bonobo_menu_subtree): Removed unnecessary (and
	#ifdeffed-out) calls to bonobo_ui_handler_set_sensitivity.
	(fm_directory_view_real_merge_menus): Removed unnecessary
	call to fm_directory_view_update_menus.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: 
	Updated menu path #defines that I needed to use later.
	(update_layout_menus): Move set_sensitive calls out of #ifdef,
	and modernize them.
	(insert_bonobo_menu_item) removed unnecessary (and
	#ifdeffed-out) call to bonobo_ui_handler_set_sensitivity
	(fm_icon_view_merge_menus): Took out code that's been
	modernized elsewhere; 
	(update_one_menu_item),	(fm_icon_view_update_menus): 
	removed #ifdefs, and modernized.
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c: 
	(update_reveal_item): New helper function
	(real_merge_menus): #ifdefs removed
	(real_update_menus): Now calls helper function, #ifdefs removed
	
	* src/file-manager/nemo-search-list-view-ui.xml: Couldn't
	resist improving a menu title
	
	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c: (load_content_view):
	modernize code setting initial zoom menu items sensitivity.
	
	* src/nemo-window-menus.c: (append_bookmark_to_menu),
	(create_menu_item_from_node),
	(nemo_window_initialize_bookmarks_menu): Added more 
	parameter checking because I saw an unreproducible
	parameter-failure crash a few levels deep.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-async.c:

	(lacks_slow_mime_type), (wants_slow_mime_type),
	(request_is_satisfied), (start_monitoring_file_list),
	(get_info_callback), (start_getting_file_info):
	Added separate ability to get file info with a 
	slow mime type in addition to the regular info.
	This call uses the same call chain, to get file info
	as the default, except it calls the async_get_file_info
	call with arguments to specify the mime type as slow.
	Since the file info structure itself doesn't 
	keep track of what kind of mime type is returned,
	we keep track of this in the nemo directory
	structure itself.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-private.h:
	Changed the file object to keep track of both
	kinds of mime types, and use the default one,
	unless specifically requested otherwise.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.h:
	(nemo_file_new_from_info), (destroy),
	(nemo_file_update_info), 
	(nemo_file_compare_by_type),
	(nemo_file_get_string_attribute),
	(nemo_file_get_type_as_string),
	(nemo_file_get_slow_mime_type), (nemo_file_get_mime_type),
	(nemo_file_is_mime_type):
	Add and extra argument to update_info,
	to describe how the mime type was received.
	Altered the mime type call, and added a get_slow_mime_type
	call.  Free and update the new mime type fields where
	appropriate.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c:
	(nemo_icon_container_start_renaming_selected_item):
	Added a comment about where we'll need to
	add code to fix bug 690
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-mime-actions.c:
	(get_mime_type_from_file):
	Updated the mime type call here to request the 
	slow mime type.

	xml shenanigans.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-list.c: (rectangle_intersect),
	(nemo_list_clear_from_row):
	Finish up 2036 - rectangular sections of list view sometimes 
	get erased. Fix up all the other list view drawing glitches that
	were showing up when invalidating the list view with other windows,
	resizing columns, etc.
	gdk_rectangle_intersect is ultra-lame and returns undefined rectangles
	when doing an intersection of two disjoint rectangles, instead of returning
	an empty rectangle with zero width/height.
	For now replaced places that relied on this behavior to be correct with a 
	call to rectangle_intersect that handles the result properly.

2000-10-04  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3155 (need feedback item in Help menu)

	Bud & co. decided this should be there all the time.

	* src/nemo-window-menus.c:
	(help_menu_nemo_feedback_callback),
	(nemo_window_initialize_menus): Added menu item
	that opens a feedback web page.

	Fixed bug 3379 (crash leaving web page)
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-async.c:
	(directory_load_done): When directory load returns an
	error, clear unconfirmed bit on all files in that directory
	so they won't be marked gone later.

	Fixed bug 3421 (web page with blank HTML title causes blank
	title in Nemo)

	* components/mozilla/nemo-mozilla-content-view.c:

	Had to create a copy of GtkCList to work around problems where the drawing
	code was getting called directly behind our derived classes back. Rebecka 
	already set GtkCList up in the cut-n-paste directory. Move it to the Nemo 
	namespace so that it doesn't collide with the original.
	Add more methods to allow completely overriding all drawing by a 
	derived class.
	Add not reached asserts in original GtkCList drawing code that was 
	messing us up.

	bars (and presumably the install ones too, though they haven't
	been tested yet) to follow the screenshots.  Tried to minimize

	Stub out previous esd/esound requirements.
	
2000-10-02  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	implemented sound process management using gconf to store the
	process ID of the currently playing sound, and switched sound
	previewing and part of the music view to use it.  This also fixed a
	process leaking bug, as each time a sound preview terminated, it
	was leaving a zombie process behind.

	(generate_xml_package_list):
	Fixed a bunch of uninitialized variable warnings. At least one was
	probably a real bug, so Eskil needs to review these changes.

	* components/rpmview/nemo-rpm-view.c:
	(nemo_rpm_view_update_from_uri): This didn't compile with the
	Red Hat 6.1 version of the rpm library. So I fixed it. I hope I
	did it right. Eskil needs to review this change.
	
	* THANKS: Victor's name needed another space between it and the

	appropriate signals at different stages of progress, which the
	NemoAdapter object hooks into (connecting with
	_connect_object_while_alive). Also, the progressive load strategy
	now checks for cancellation around various CORBA calls, so it
	should actually respect the stop button.

	opposed to having three different fetchers. So I've removed
	_which_provides and I need to remove _by_id.

	theres a packagesystem dependent depchecker and a seperate filedep
	check afterwards. The packagesystem dependent returns a list of
	package pairs <a,b>, where a requires b. fetch_dependencies then
	traverses that list, downloads and makes the nessecary checks. The
	makes fetch_dependencies package independent, and also fixes bug

	using the name field, the conflicts_checked boolean to prevent
	doing file conflict checking more then once and a boolean flag for
	tagging a package as being a source package.
	Also fixed 3344, the file list is now read correctly.
 	Created	the PacakgeRequirement structure, used for bug 3373.

	used to change content views, given a new view identifier.

	use the new nemo_window_set_sidebar_panels call.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_stretch_handles), (draw_stretch_handles_aa):
	fixed bug 3283, bits of icons protrude outside the
	stretch box, by making drawing the box at the actual bounds
	instead of insetting three pixels like we were doing.
	
2000-10-02  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed the worst part of bug 2068 (dragging icon causes
	immediate update of scroll area). Some related bugs
	remain, which I'll write up separately

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gnome-extensions.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gnome-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gnome_canvas_set_scroll_region_include_visible_area):
	New function, sets scroll region to given parameters,
	also forcing visible area to be included.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c:
	(update_scroll_region): New function, extracted from
	nemo_icon_container_update_scroll_region, now takes
	boolean for whether to include the visible area.
	(nemo_icon_container_update_scroll_region): Now calls
	update_scroll_region.
	(nemo_icon_container_update_scroll_region_include_visible_area):
	New function, calls update_scroll_region.
	(size_allocate): Do no work if allocation hasn't changed. This
	didn't help with bug 2068 but is a worthwhile optimization.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-private.h:
	Prototype for nemo_icon_container_update_scroll_region_
	include_visible_area

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-dnd.c: (handle_local_move):
	call ..._include_visible_area when updating scroll region after
	drag & drop, instead of just ..._update_scroll_region, so no
	origin-shifting occurs.

	(nemo_property_browser_set_category):
	fixed bug 3217, better separation of text in property browser so

	equivalent is now in the NemoDirectory version,
	replaced with comment.

2000-09-29  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/music/nemo-music-view.c:
	(nemo_music_view_update_from_uri):
	fixed bug 2107, music view fails when encountering a broken image file,
	by testing for a NULL result from gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file and
	handling it accordingly.

2000-09-29  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-thumbnails.c:
	(check_for_thumbnails):
	finished fixing bug 3342, thumbnailing never gives up on bad images,
	by generating a unique "cant thumbnail" icon when thumbnailing fails.
	Right now it's using the generic image icon; I still need a better
	one from Susan.
	
2000-09-29  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2602, Integrate gnome-vfs http proxy setting into Mozilla
	component.
	
	* components/mozilla/Makefile.am:
	* components/mozilla/nemo-mozilla-content-view.c:
	(nemo_mozilla_content_view_initialize):
	Check for proxy settings and init mozilla to use them.
	
	Fixed bug 2692, Need to let user specify a proxy for Mozilla
	component.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-global-preferences.c:
	(use_proxy_changed), (proxy_changed),
	(global_preferences_register):

	When the Nemo preferences mechanism supports system wide settings,
	we should revisit this code and remove the gconf system prefs retrieval
	code.

2000-09-29  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-thumbnails.c:
	(check_for_thumbnails):
	partially fixed bug 3342, thumbnailing never gives up on bad images.
	If thumbnailing failed, it would obsessively try over and over since
	it was calling nemo_file_changed even if it failed.  Fixed by
	calling nemo_file_changed only when it succeeds. It still will
	try once each time you enter the containing directory, and it has
	the wrong icon, both of which I'll fix soon.

	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_constructed):
	Removed non-working clipboard code

2000-09-29  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3327 (intermittent tree view crash)

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_get_internal): Changed file_name_escaped
	to file_name in nemo_str_is_empty call. 
	file_name_escaped had already been freed at this point
	(Doh!). Darin and I believe this to be the cause of
	3327 (and testers agree). Also freed file_name later, 
	which had been leaking.

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-model.c:
	(nemo_tree_model_get_node): Removed extra debugging
	spam from here now that bug is fixed. We can bring it
	back later if necessary.
	

2000-09-29  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

2000-09-29  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/music/nemo-music-view.c: (play_current_file),

	present, by seeing if we can successfully open the sound device.
	Still need to fix sound previewing similarily
	
2000-09-28  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* icons/chit_frame.png:

	Not sure if these are final yet.

2000-09-28  Josh Barrow  <josh@eazel.com>

	* docs/smoketests.html:
	Changed my e-mail address

2000-09-28  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-model.c
	(nemo_tree_model_get_node, dump_one_file_node): Enhance
	debugging output to include hex addresses of files when we hit the
	mysterious intermittent failure.

2000-09-28  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed part of bug 3322 (context menus don't work correctly
	in icon view when using FTP). Now there is no degenerate menu
	displayed, but the real menu still doesn't appear due to the
	remaining selection bug.

	Also did some more work to make some sidebar view failures 
	less deadly to Nemo.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(create_selection_context_menu): Complain and return NULL if
	no files are selected.
	(fm_directory_view_pop_up_selection_context_menu):
	Don't put up a menu at all if create_selection_context_menu
	returned NULL.

	* src/nemo-window-private.h: 
	Added field details->dead_view_name.
	* src/nemo-view-frame.c: (nemo_view_frame_get_label):
	return-if-fail if view frame has already been destroyed but
	not finalized (so details is NULL). It used to segfault. I
	also changed the one caller I knew about that sometimes called
	this function in this situation.
	
	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_set_state_info): in VIEW_ERROR case, store the
	name of the (first) failing view frame here, where it can still
	be reliably read.
	(nemo_window_update_state): Removed redundant and misleading
	window->error_views != NULL check; changed if/else logic to
	not check whether new_content_view is also content_view, since 
	when this check failed the code would assume that new_content_view
	was a sidebar panel (I don't know of anyone ever running into
	this case though); free and NULL out dead_view_name after
	processing first error_view.
	(report_sidebar_panel_failure_to_user): Use previously-stored
	dead_view_name rather than trusting the view frame to still
	have useful information in this case, since it doesn't in
	the many cases where it self-destructed when running into
	a problem.
	(nemo_window_end_location_change_callback): Tweaked an
	error message.
	
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_destroy):
	free details->dead_view_name.

2000-09-28  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(get_property_names_from_uri):

	properties window.
	
	* src/nemo-property-browser.c: (make_color_drag_image),
	(element_clicked_callback), (make_properties_from_xml_node):

	image backgrounds
	
	* icons/backgrounds.png:
	* icons/colors.png:
	* icons/emblems.png:
	* icons/chit_frame.png:
	tweaked images from Susan for the property browser
	
	* icons/i-music-aa.png:
	Susan fixed Eli's time signature bug in the music icon
	
2000-09-28  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 2688. back and forward buttons do not work 
	with mozilla.
	* components/mozilla/nemo-mozilla-content-view.c:
	(nemo_mozilla_content_view_load_uri),
	(mozilla_location_changed_callback), 
	(mozilla_open_uri_callback): add a flag to remember
	when nemo calls the component and another to remember 
	when the user clicks on a button.

2000-09-28  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed renaming bug with names with unusual characters and problems
	caused by the clipboard code, and started work on metadata copying
	and removing implementation and cleanup.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-operations.c:
	(nemo_file_operations_new_folder): Use
	gnome_vfs_uri_append_file_name instead of
	gnome_vfs_uri_append_path, since we are appending a file name, not
	a path in URI format.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-utilities.c:
	(nemo_get_user_main_directory): Use
	gnome_vfs_uri_append_file_name instead of
	gnome_vfs_uri_append_path, since we are appending a file name, not
	a path in URI format.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(rename_update_info_and_metafile): Use metadata call by new name.
	(nemo_file_rename): Use gnome_vfs_uri_append_file_name instead
	of gnome_vfs_uri_append_path, since we are appending a file name,
	not a path in URI format. This should fix the renaming problems we
	were seeing.
	
	* libnemo/nemo-clipboard.h:
	* libnemo/nemo-clipboard.c:
	(set_paste_sensitive_if_clipboard_contains_data),
	(set_clipboard_menu_items_sensitive),
	(set_clipboard_menu_items_insensitive): Removed unused window
	parameter.
	(menu_activated_callback): Changed this function to find the
	window using gtk_widget_toplevel instead of from a global. This
	works in all the cases where the old code would have worked, and
	doesn't have the problem with multiple windows.
	(menu_deactivated_callback): Removed unused window parameter.
	(nemo_clipboard_set_up_editable_from_bonobo_control): Added
	check for NULL menubar. This shows a design problem too, but at
	least it 
	(nemo_clipboard_set_up_host_ui_handler): Got rid of global.
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_constructed): Use
	clipboard call by new name.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory.c:
	(nemo_directory_schedule_metadata_copy),
	(nemo_directory_schedule_metadata_move),
	(nemo_directory_schedule_metadata_remove),
	(nemo_directory_schedule_position_setting): Tighten up these
	routines a bit and have them do as much work as possible through
	functions in nemo-directory-metafile.[ch]. This is preparation
	for doing full implementation of the actual metadata copying.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-metafile.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-metafile.c:
	(nemo_directory_rename_file_metadata),
	(copy_file_metadata_for_key),
	(nemo_directory_copy_file_metadata),
	(nemo_directory_remove_file_metadata): New functions to doteh
	metadata copying, and a new name for an old function.  Now I have
	to actually make them work better.
	
	* nemo.spec.in: Do a "make check" instead of a "make" when
	building RPMs.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c:
	(match_best_name), (compare_icons_by_name),
	(nemo_icon_container_start_renaming_selected_item):
	Fixed a segfault I ran into by accidentally typing
	into a Nemo window before it was fully displayed.
	Some icon-container code was assuming that 
	nemo_icon_canvas_item_get_editable_text never
	returned NULL, but right after the directory is loaded
	this assumption is valid. Fixed all similar offenders.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c:
	(nemo_icon_factory_get_icon_for_file):
	mostly fixed bug 3158, unacceptable memory usage when thumbnailing,
	by implementing an upper bound on the file size, above which it
	won't try to thumbnail - it's currently set to 1 megabyte, but it
	needs to be tweaked. We still need to give the "too big to thumbnail"
	files a distinctive icon.

2000-09-27  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1010 (delay between when an item gets selected
	and revealed).

	The delay was there for two reasons, one of which was a mistaken
	accident of history. Reduced the delay from 300ms to 10ms in icon
	view, and to 0ms in list view. Couldn't reduce the icon view delay
	to 0ms due to problems with the scroll/redraw being unable to keep
	up with holding the arrow key down. The current settings seem to
	work well in both views, though it would be worthwhile to verify
	this on a maximally-slow target machine.

	Fixed bugs 691, 689, and 733.  Hopeully this also
	fixes 690, but I can't test it, because rename in
	place is confused on my system

2000-09-26  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Got leaks in "nemo --check" down to 0.
	
	Fixed bug 2488 (path name for link set determined incorrectly) by
	using only paths for link sets, never URIs.

	* tools/leak-checker/nemo-leak-checker.c: Added more "known to
	leak" symbols.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-link-set.c: (create_new_link),
	(nemo_link_set_is_installed), (nemo_link_set_remove):
	Changed functions to always expect paths, so they can now use
	nemo_make_path instead of link_set_path_name.
	* src/nemo-sidebar.c: (metadata_button_callback): Changed to
	turn the URI into a path before calling the link-set functions.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory.c:
	(nemo_directory_notify_files_moved): Use
	nemo_file_list_free instead of
	nemo_g_list_free_deep_custom.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-string-list.c:
	(nemo_string_list_clear): Use nemo_g_list_free_deep
	instead of nemo_g_list_free_deep_custom.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-view-identifier.c:
	(nemo_view_identifier_free_callback),
	(nemo_view_identifier_list_free): Fixed call to
	nemo_g_list_free_deep_custom so it doesn't need a function
	pointer type cast any more.
	
2000-09-26  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* src/nemo-theme-selector.c: (add_theme_to_icons),

	(nemo_view_frame_destroy), (nemo_view_frame_load_client):
	NULL freed' fields.
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_real_set_content_view):
	idem.

2000-09-26  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 382 (Deleting file viewed in other window leaves
	other window in bad state)

	Also ran into some tree view problems that I did not fix
	but made less deadly so I could continue.

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-view.c:
	(nemo_tree_view_model_done_loading_callback),
	(reload_node_for_uri):
	Added g_return_if_fails checking the model and node parameters, 
	so it won't segfault with a NULL node. I did not attempt to
	debug why the nodes were NULL.
	
	* src/nemo-window-private.h: Added viewed_file field to
	details struct.

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(viewed_file_changed_callback): New function, closes window if
	viewed_file is gone.
	(nemo_window_update_internals): Set viewed_file to
	NemoFile for this location (after unreffing old one), and 
	connect to its "changed" signal	with viewed_file_changed_callback.
	(nemo_window_end_location_change_callback): Truncate the 
	"for display" version of the URI in error messages.
	
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_destroy):

	(nemo_read_file_async), (nemo_read_file_cancel):
	Experimental replacement for the nemo_read_file_async
	as a potential speed improvement. Need to do some more profiling
	to see if we are getting any gain.

2000-09-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-thumbnails.c:
	(nemo_get_thumbnail_uri), (check_for_thumbnails),
	(make_thumbnails):
	fixed big 2932, nemo doesn't finish making
	thumbnails if there is a problematic image, by changing the logic
	of how it determines when a thumbnail is made.  Now it simply checks
	if the thumbnail task has terminated, instead of checking for
	the created thumbnail, so failures shouldn't faze it anymore.  Also
	fixed some other associated bugs.
	
2000-09-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Band-aid for bug 2752 (intermittent failure trying to
	use Help Contents)

	* src/nemo-view-frame.c:
	(nemo_view_frame_load_client): Upped a hardcoded
	timeout from 2 seconds to 10 seconds; also added an
	assert that might help us fix the underlying problem
	later.

2000-09-25  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug bug 3264 (Tree view shows no branches for directories,
	...HACK... nodes visible), bug 3290 (changing directory or
	refreshing causes Gdk to assert), bug 2420 (Need to free original
	key when removing model node), and other assorted problems.

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-view.c: (insert_hack_node),
	(remove_hack_node), (nemo_tree_view_insert_model_node):
	Fix problem where the hash table key was neither g_strdup'd on the
	way in, nor g_free'd on the way out. This caused all the problems
	with bad nesting in the tree view.
	
	* nemo-installer/src/installer.c: (create_pixmap):
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (install_row_images):

	After Tim Janik explained that gtk_type_new is a low-level call to
	be avoided, changed most uses of gtk_type_new to gtk_object_new or
	gtk_widget_new. Also, after Owen and Havoc explained that you
	can't just ignore the floating bit, added ref/sink calls to the

	scheme.
	
	* src/nemo-zoom-control.c:

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_get_internal):
	(get_nemo_navigation_result_from_gnome_vfs_result):
	Fixed problem I ran into while debugging something else.
	When gnome_vfs_uri_extract_short_name returned NULL from
	a URI like "http://foo:", this routine got into trouble.
	Rearranged code to check for the no-short-name case
	earlier and fall back to the mystery-uri handling.

	* src/nemo-applicable-views.c:
	Changed a g_message to a g_warning so people will tell
	me about problems even more often.

2000-09-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-theme-selector.c: (make_theme_description):
	fixed bug where the theme descriptions were not showing up in
	the theme selector; the problem was that the xml routines couldn't
	handle a uri, so fixed by calling gnome_vfs_get_local_path_from_uri.

	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-redirect.c:
	(check_gconf_init):

	Fixing the background color errors that prevent testing.  I have not
	figured out how to set the parent form default color without causing
	major instability.  Also added the fetch of the url location tables
	from services.

2000-09-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	finished the work for user-added themes, teaching the icon
	factory and other machinery to look in ~/.nemo/themes to
	find theme
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c: (set_theme),
	(make_full_icon_path), (get_themed_icon_file_path):
	added a "local_theme" instance variable, determined it's state
	during set_theme and used it to make full paths.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-theme.c: (load_theme_document),
	(nemo_theme_get_theme_data),
	(nemo_pixmap_file_may_be_local),

	made various routines look at the local theme store when necessary
	
2000-09-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Some work on the "sidebar panel has failed" situation.

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_update_state): Don't report sidebar panel
	failure when the view that failed was the content view.
	Doh! It had been putting up two dialogs, one for the content
	view and one for some mysterious unknown sidebar panel.
	(nemo_window_set_state_info): Added a g_warning when
	the state is set to VIEW_ERROR. This will stop in the debugger
	to make it easier to tell what's generating the error (but
	without the debugger will just spew one line of spam).
	
	(nemo_window_end_location_change_callback): Check if
	window is visible before trying to set the initial
	position. This prevents a return_if_fail complaint in some
	cases in the window-position-saving code when using 
	use-new-window mode.

	Fixed bug 3262 (Zoom control context menu should use
	radio buttons, not checkboxes)

	* src/nemo-zoom-control.c: 
	Added marking_menu_items boolean to details struct.
	(create_zoom_menu_item): Now takes a radio button item
	as a parameter (from which to get the group) and returns
	the new radio button item (to use for the next time) and
	sets marking_menu_items to TRUE while creating menu items.
	Oh yeah, also creates a radio item instead of a check item.
	(zoom_menu_callback): Now bails out early if marking_menu_items.
	(create_zoom_menu): Passes the result of each create_zoom_menu_item
	into the next call, to get all the radio items in the same group.

	updated to conform to screenshot.

	Fixed bug 2877, Keyboard selection feedback broken in
	iocn view for smooth fonts.

	(draw_focus_rect):
	New function to draw dashed selection rect.  Dash size

	Call new draw_focus_rect when item focus is set.

2000-09-25  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-view.c:
	(nemo_tree_view_insert_model_node),
	(nemo_tree_view_update_model_node): Check for NULL
	before calling gdk_bitmap_unref (mask); it was hitting
	a return_if_fail NULL check a zillion times on startup
	in the tree view.

2000-09-25  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-component-adapter-factory.c:
	(nemo_component_adapter_factory_initialize),
	(nemo_component_adapter_factory_destroy),
	(nemo_component_adapter_factory_get):
	Fix some NULL-dereferencing crashers that I was hitting.

	* tools/profiler/funcsummary.C:
	Special case root arcs with zero function times.

2000-09-25  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	work toward completing user added themes; it's almost done

	* src/nemo-theme-selector.c: (uri_get_basename),
	(add_theme_to_icons), (make_theme_description), (add_theme),
	(populate_list_with_themes_from_directory),
	(populate_list_with_themes):
	made the theme selector install themes properly, and made it
	reflect themes that were installed in the user space
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-theme.c:
	(nemo_theme_make_selector):
	made it look in both theme spaces to retrieve an icons.

2000-09-24  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>
	
	* src/nemo-throbber.c: (get_throbber_dimensions),
	(load_themed_image), (nemo_throbber_load_images),
	(nemo_throbber_button_press_event),
	(nemo_throbber_set_small_mode):
	implemented a small mode for the throbber to fix bug 3188.  Also,
	cleaned up some other throbber problems.
	* src/nemo-throbber.h:
	added nemo_throbber_set_small_mode, as part of fixing 3188
	* src/nemo-window-toolbars.c: (allocate_throbber):
	set the small mode when necessary
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-utilities.c:
	(nemo_make_directory_and_parents), (nemo_copy_uri_simple):
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-utilities.h:
	added a "nemo_copy_uri_simple" cover to gnome_vfs_xfer_uri to
	make it easy to replace 'cp' system calls.
	
	* src/nemo-property-browser.c:
	(nemo_property_browser_initialize),
	(nemo_property_browser_destroy), (make_drag_image),
	(make_color_drag_image), (remove_background), (remove_emblem),
	(add_background_to_browser), (emblem_dialog_clicked),
	(make_property_tile), (make_properties_from_directories),
	(make_properties_from_xml_node):
	changed the way colors are presented by the property browser to
	use names instead of color values and to be more consistent with
	backgrounds.  Also, cleaned up the error handling and replaced
        'system' calls that had quoting problems with vfs calls, fixing bugs
	1249 and 2539

2000-09-24  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gnome-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gnome_open_terminal):
	Make the terminals besides GNOME-terminal login as well.
	Also did some more cleaning up after myself.

2000-09-24  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* check-THANKS.pl: New script to make sure we're giving credit
	appropriately - should be run before releases to make sure.
	
	* THANKS: Removed those who have been promoted to AUTHORS.
	
	* ChangeLog-20000625, ChangeLog-20000831: Made a few minor edits
	to avoid confusing check-THANKS.pl

2000-09-23  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-toolbar.c: (nemo_toolbar_initialize_class),
	(nemo_toolbar_size_allocate), (nemo_toolbar_size_request):
	fixed bug 3186 and assorted other problems involving the throbber
	messing up toolbar resizing, by implementing
	nemo_toolbar_size_request. Now it sizes correctly when you
	pull it out of the window.
	
2000-09-23  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-window-toolbars.c: (set_up_button):
	fixed bug where toolbar icon theme indirection was broken,
	so now the new ardmore theme uses the blue toolbar icons like
	Susan intended.
	
2000-09-23  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gnome-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gnome_open_terminal):
	Make the fix prettier.

2000-09-23  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gnome-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gnome_open_terminal):
	Changed terminal_path_with_flags to terminal_path.  I had 
	changed one instance trying to get this to work, then forgot
	to change it back.

2000-09-23  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gnome-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gnome_open_terminal):
	Make GNOME-terminal start with the right flags.  This fixes
	bug 2226.

2000-09-23  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	optimized the new selection highlighting by fetching the
	highlight frame once for the icon canvas instead of for each
	selected item

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-private.h:
	added field for highlight frame
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c: (destroy),
	(nemo_icon_container_initialize):
	load and destroy the highlight frame as necessary
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_label_text_aa):
	use the highlight frame from the canvas
	
2000-09-22  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	Register all the below components per display. I didn't make
	nemo per-display yet (to avoid dealing with the locking
	issues, etc). I also did not change the services components that
	appear to be non-gui to operate per-display.

	I believe this fixes bugs 3033 and 2237.

	* components/adapter/main.c: (main):
	* components/hardware/main.c: (main):
	* components/help/hyperbola-main.c: (main):

2000-09-22  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gdk-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gradient_parse_one_color_spec):
	fixed glitch in Michael's gradient parsing logic that was
	mishandling three-point gradients and making Arlo's sidebar
	draw wrong.
	
2000-09-22  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	implemented Arlo's new design for icon selection highlighting.
	It's still not finished; it needs to be optimized and refined in
	various ways.
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	* icons/text-selection-frame.png
	added semi-transparent text selection frame image
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-graphic-effects.c,h:
	(nemo_stretch_frame_image), (nemo_embed_image_in_frame):
	exposed the stretch frame image routine
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_or_measure_label_text_aa), (draw_label_text_aa):
	implemented the new, transparent highlighting.
	
2000-09-22  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Storage leak fixes. Today I concentrated on leaks that happen
	when you change views from Icon to List View and back.

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-view.c:
	(nemo_tree_view_insert_model_node): Unref a pixmap and bitmap,
	free a string.
	(nemo_tree_view_update_model_node): Unref a pixmap and bitmap,
	free a string.
	(notify_node_seen): Free a string.
	(nemo_tree_view_uri_to_name): Removed extra g_strdup.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-glib-extensions.c:
	(free_hash_tables_at_exit): Free a list.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-list.c: (draw_cell): Skip the
	excess work of re-getting the pixmap and bitmap, not using them,
	and leaking them.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-preferences.c:
	(preferences_hash_node_remove_callback): Free a list.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: (queue_pending_files):
	Free a list.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (get_icon_text_callback):
	Free a string in all code paths (was freed in some before).
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (add_to_list): Free the column
	text in a way that works even though some columns have NULL.
	(install_row_images): Unref a pixmap and bitmap.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-scalable-font.c:
	(destroy_global_rsvg_ft_context),
	(initialize_global_stuff_if_needed): Free the rsvg_ft font cache
	at exit.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-theme.c: (free_last_theme),
	(nemo_theme_get_theme_data): Free the cached theme XML
	document at exit.
	
	* components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/gdb3html.c:
	(remove_head), (start_element), (end_element), (cdata_block):
	* components/tree/nemo-tree-model.c:
	(nemo_tree_model_for_each_postorder),

	(property_button_toggled):
	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c: (handle_go_back),
	(handle_go_forward):
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_add_to_history_list):
	Fixed a bunch of callers of g_list_remove_link to also free the
	removed link. This seems to be an error-prone API from glib.
	About half of the callers had it wrong.
	
	* src/nemo-bookmark-list.c:
	(nemo_bookmark_list_delete_item_at),
	(nemo_bookmark_list_delete_items_with_uri):
	* src/nemo-sidebar.c: (receive_dropped_keyword):
	Changed to use g_list_free_1 for clarity.
	
	* src/nemo-location-bar.c: Coding style tweaks.
	
	* src/nemo-main.c: (main): Run the self-checks a second time
	if they succeed the first time. More thorough check this way (make
	sure the test works even after it's been run once), and better to
	notice one-time vs. per-test leaks.
	
	* tools/leak-checker/nemo-leak-checker.c: (g_slist_alloc),
	(g_slist_free), (g_slist_free_1), (g_mem_chunk_new),
	(g_mem_chunk_destroy), (g_mem_chunk_alloc), (g_mem_chunk_alloc0),
	(g_mem_chunk_free), (g_mem_chunk_clean), (g_mem_chunk_reset),
	(g_mem_chunk_print): Made the GSList and GMemChunk code dumb down
	when using the leak checker.

	* tools/leak-checker/nemo-leak-checker.c: Added more symbols
	of "known to leak" functions so we can see the real leakers.

2000-09-22  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	horizontal & vertical desktop gradient settings were
	being written out bassackwards: bug 3247.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-background.c:
	(nemo_directory_background_write_desktop_settings):

2000-09-22  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	Sped up gradient drawing. Also changed the n-point
	gradient syntax to use a '%' to indicate percentage
	instead of a '|'.
	* icons/arlo/arlo.xml:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-background.c:
	(nemo_background_destroy), (reset_cached_color_info),
	(ensure_gradient_buffered), (gradient_helper_v),
	(gradient_helper_h), (fill_canvas_from_gradient_buffer),
	(nemo_background_draw), (draw_pixbuf_tiled_aa),

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-object.c:
	(eazel_install_delete_downloads):
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-protocols.c:
	(eazel_install_fetch_file), (real_arch_name),
	(get_search_url_for_package):
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-rpm-glue.c:
	(eazel_install_start_transaction),
	(eazel_install_package_provides_compare),
	(eazel_install_package_modifies_provides_compare):

	Hack the installer lib to munge "i?86" => "i386" so as not to
	confuse the RPM queries.  (This can be removed later: the java
	team says they will do this munging themselves.)  Don't add
	duplicate entries to the downloaded_files GList.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.c:
	(categorydata_destroy_foreach):
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-types.h:
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-xml-package-list.c:

	* nemo-installer/src/installer.c: (category_compare_func),
	(toggle_button_toggled), (eazel_install_get_depends),
	(eazel_installer_initialize):
	* nemo-installer/src/installer.h:
	
	Add "depends" GList to CategoryData, so that the info about
	buttons in the bootstrap installer can be pulled out of the
	package-list.xml and not require a bogus 2nd XML file.  Add that
	extra parsing to the install lib XML parser and make it more
	robust.  Convert bootstrap installer to use the info in its new
	place and junk the redundant XML parser.

2000-09-22  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-location-bar.c: (nemo_location_bar_initialize),
	(nemo_location_bar_update_label):
	at Arlo's request, right justified the location bar label, now
	that it switches between "location" and "go to".
	
2000-09-22  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-first-time-druid.c: (druid_finished):

	Fixing urls for the first time druid so that they do
	not point to the eazel: redirect nonsense.

2000-09-22  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (fm_icon_view_destroy),
	(fm_icon_view_begin_loading):
	fixed bug 1038, sound file being previewed doesn't stop playing
	when the view switches, by explicitly terminating the sound process
	when the icon view is destroyed or a new directory is loaded.
	
2000-09-22  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/login/nemo-view/nemo-login-view.oafin
	fo:
	point eazel-pw to the change password dialog.  Will finish the full
	renaming a little later but needed to go ahead and use the correct uri.

2000-09-22  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 168 (Save and restore window position/size per
	directory)

	Note that this is only done when in "use separate windows
	for everything" mode. My brain broke trying to figure out
	how it could be used coherently in single-window mode.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gtk-extensions.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gtk-extensions.c:
	(sanity_check_window_geometry): New helper function, takes
	four coordinates and munges them if necessary to keep the
	window at least partially on screen and not ridiculously
	huge.
	(nemo_gtk_window_set_initial_geometry): New function,
	sets the position/location of a window before it is shown
	after calling sanity_check_window_geometry on 
	top/left/width/height parameters.
	(nemo_gtk_window_set_initial_geometry_from_string):
	New function, calls _set_initial_geometry after parsing
	geometry-as-string parameter and adjusting it for
	minimum-width and minimum-height parameters.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-metadata.h:
	#define new per-directory key for window geometry
	
	* src/nemo-application.c:
	(nemo_window_delete_event_callback): New function,
	calls nemo_window_close.
	(nemo_application_create_window): Hook up this new
	callback as signal handler for window's delete_event;
	this causes closing the window from the close box go
	through the same nemo_window_close path that closing
	the window from the menu did.
	
	* src/nemo-bookmarks-window.c:
	(nemo_bookmarks_window_restore_geometry):
	Now calls nemo_gtk_window_set_geometry_from_string,
	which was extracted from here.
	
	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(position_and_show_window_callback): New function, reads
	geometry string for this location from metadata & applies
	it (if in use-new-window mode), then shows window.
	(nemo_window_end_location_change_callback):
	Use nemo_directory_call_when_ready to show the window
	only after the metadata has been read, so it doesn't appear
	in one position and then bounce elsewhere.
	
	* src/nemo-window-menus.c: (file_menu_new_window_callback):
	Removed gtk_widget_show from here. It wasn't necessary since
	the window is shown later after the URI is determined to be good,
	and doing it here prevented the window positioning code from
	working correctly.
	
	* src/nemo-window-private.h: Moved some window geometry
	#defines in here.
	
	* src/nemo-window.c: 
	(nemo_window_save_geometry): New private function, reads
	the window geometry and stores it in the directory's metadata.
	(nemo_window_close): Calls nemo_window_save_geometry
	if we're in use-new-windows mode.

2000-09-22  Robin * Slomkowski  <rslomkow@eazel.com>

	* nemo.spec.in: added --enable-more-warnings

2000-09-22  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* tools/profiler/symbol-table.h:
	Tweak the profiler output adding a code address.

2000-09-22  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	in response to user testing, made the location bar label switch to
	"Go to:" during input when the text doesn't match the uri.
	
	* src/nemo-location-bar.h:
	added "last_location" field
	* src/nemo-location-bar.c: (editable_key_press_callback),
	(destroy), (nemo_location_bar_initialize),
	(nemo_location_bar_set_location),
	(nemo_location_bar_update_label):
	maintained last_location field; when anything changes, set the label
	to "location" if the contents match last_location and "goto"
	otherwise.
	
2000-09-21  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* tools/profiler/nemo-leak-symbol-lookup.C:
	Enable bfd symbol lookup.

2000-09-21  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2598 ("Select All Files" should be insensitive in
	views that have 0 files)

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c: 
	(no_items_showing): New function, checks directory item
	count. I can trust this now that the directory item count
	filters the same way the directory view does, thanks to
	rebecka's recent change.
	(compute_menu_item_info): Use no_items_showing to set the
	sensitivity of "Select All Files".

2000-09-21  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3236 (Window titles are indistinguishable in taskbar)

	Removed "Nemo: " from the main Nemo window and all
	the dialogs. Took this opportunity to standardize on book title
	capitalization for all dialog titles. Also softened the caveat
	text just a bit.

2000-09-21  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixes to leaks and the leak checker.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-preference.c:
	(nemo_self_check_preference): Unref an object that was
	leaking.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-string-list.c:
	(nemo_self_check_string_list): Unref an object that was
	leaking.

	(user_level_manager_ensure_global_manager): Unref the user level
	manager at exit time.
	* src/nemo-main.c: (main): Free the context even in the
	self-check case.
	* tools/leak-checker/nemo-leak-checker.c:
	(nemo_leak_record_malloc), (nemo_leak_record_realloc),
	(nemo_leak_record_free) : Don't gather stats on the blocks as

	(total_one_leak): Compute totals for printing.
	(create_bad_names_hash_table): Make a hash table to use to check
	if a name is one of the "allowed to leak" functions.
	(is_stack_crawl_good): Reject stack crawls from things that are
	allowed to leak. "good" here means "worth keeping".
	(print_one_leak): Don't print any "?" if there's only a single
	leak, since all levels of the stack crawl are valid then.
	(nemo_leak_print_leaks): Filter out expected leaks.
	(g_list_alloc), (g_list_free), (g_list_free_1), (g_node_new),
	(g_nodes_free), (g_node_destroy): Versions of these functions that

	nemo_uri_is_canonical.

2000-09-21  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>
	Cut and pasted the gtkclist widget into

2000-09-21  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2090, Sidebar panel shrinks when back from text
	or image view to directory view.
		
	* src/nemo-sidebar.c: (make_button_box),
	(nemo_sidebar_update_buttons):
	Fixed logic where button centering was being shown

	* components/image-viewer/nemo-image-view.c: (redraw_view),

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_stretch_handles_aa):
	
	fixed bugs 3084, 3119, 3134, icon stretch handles are not drawn
	in the right place or hit-tested properly, by removing some
	bogus offsets.
		
	fixed bugs 764 and 2626, icon stretching is way too slow, by only
	doing the relayout and update position when the stretching is
	finished, instead of doing it every time the mouse moves during
	the stretch.  Also, made it relayout if necessary after stretching
	is finished, like it was intending to do.

	Handle GNOME_VFS_ERROR_EOF properly, now that we get this result
	instead of just relying on getting 0 bytes read.

2000-09-21  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-model.c: (report_node_changed):
	Add ref/unref to fix problem with renaming.
	
	* src/check-nemo: Add "--g-fatal-warnings" so tests fail if
	there are warning messages.

2000-09-21  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* icons/theme_preview.png:
	Goofed up the last icon and put the document icon to
	far to the right.  This made it where the icon was 
	being cut off when viewed.

2000-09-21  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* icons/theme_preview.png:
	Updated theme preview icon to better reflect what the
	actual theme looks like.

2000-09-21  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* components/music/mpg123_handler.c:

2000-09-20  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-operations.c:
	(parse_previous_duplicate_name), (make_next_duplicate_name):
	Fix a duplicate name generator bug that caused make check to fail.
	Remove some string pasting that would make localization impossible.
	Add better comments to duplicate name string fragments to make it clearer
	to localizers.

2000-09-21  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* data/browser.xml:
	fixed bug 3169, emblems should come last in property browser,
	by changing the order in the xml definition file.
	
2000-09-20  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.c:
	(file_read_callback):
	
	fixed problem where background images were not being displayed. 
	Maciej recently fixed gnome-vfs to return EOF errors when appropriate;
	unfortunately, that broke nemo_gdk_pixbuf_load_async, which was
	reading until it got an EOF but not returning the pixbuf if it got
	an error of any kind.  Fixed by checking for EOF and allowing it; a
	better fix might be to read the file size and only read the
	proper amount, which we might consider doing later.

	(though this won't work under userhelper, thanks userhelper).
	
2000-09-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	The following two NemoDirectory fixes fix bugzilla.eazel.com
	bug 2894:

	(request_is_satisfied): Check for
	directory_loaded_set_notification as well as directory_loaded.

	(nemo_directory_stop_monitoring_file_list): When we dump the
	file list, we also need to indicate that the directory is no
	longer loaded.

	Added new "advice" for bug 1874, to provide advice.
	I am not sure what sort of advice we should be
	giving, so I welcome recommendations on this matter.

2000-09-20  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	First step fixing storage leaks: Fixed some ref. count leaks of
	NemoFile, NemoDirectory, and NemoScalableIcon.
	
	* components/tree/nemo-tree-model.c: (remove_all_nodes):
	Unref the root node when we are done with it.
	(report_root_node_if_possible): Use report_node_changed for
	new nodes as well.
	(report_node_changed): Since a new node and a changed node are
	really the same, just use this instead of using a different call
	for added vs. changed.
	(nemo_tree_model_directory_files_changed_callback): Ref
	the node when it's being added to the hash table. Get rid of
	the misguided code that would ref "because remove will unref"
	and instead use a more normal model.
	(nemo_tree_model_directory_files_added_callback): Fix a
	storage leak in the case where we generate a warning. Changed it
	from a printf to a g_warning. Use report_node_changed for new
	nodes as well. Unref the node after adding it to use a more normal
	ref model; handles cases where it's already in there properly, for
	one thing.
	* components/tree/nemo-tree-node.c:
	(nemo_tree_node_set_parent): Changed an assert to a
	return_if_fail.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-bookmark.c:
	(nemo_bookmark_update_icon): Change the code to take the fact
	that nemo_icon_factory_get_icon_for_file yields a new ref into
	account to plug a NemoScalableIcon leak.
	
	* src/nemo-bookmark-parsing.c:
	(nemo_bookmark_new_from_node): Unref the icon after creating a
	new bookmark. If the bookmark needs to keep it, it will ref it.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (get_icon_images_callback):
	Extra space in here.

2000-09-20  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/adapter/Makefile.am:
	* cut-n-paste-code/freetype/Makefile.am: Make the tinderbox a bit
	happier by mentioning some files that were missing from these
	makefiles.

2000-09-20  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* cut-n-paste-code/freetype/ftdebug.h: Fixed compiling with newer
	gcc. Freetype was trying to use token pasting to attach the name
	of a function (FTMessage) onto the parameters to that
	function. There's no need to attempt this, and it's incorrect. I
	removed the token pasting attempt. Perhaps Raph should get this
	rolled back into the main freetype soruces.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/bonobo-stream-vfs.c: Cleaned up the code
	a bit to match Nemo coding style and remove some redundant
	stuff.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-bookmark.c:
	(nemo_bookmark_update_icon): Fixed a place where we unref the
	old value before ref'ing the new one. It's not really a bug, but
	it's a good habit to ref the new value first. Ran into this when
	I started looking for NemoScalableIcon leaks.

2000-09-20  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-complex-search-bar.c: (fewer_options_callback):
	Reinstated a less vile form of the queue_resize hack that had
	been here now that Rebecca and I discovered that without it the
	toolbar doesn't shrink correctly when the window is very wide.

2000-09-20  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>

	* po/POTFILES.in:
	Fixed a build problem that was caused by a removed
	file not being removed from here.
	* src/file-manager/nemo-indexing-info.c:
	(nemo_indexing_info_show_dialog):
	Add place-holder index progress indicator in the indexing
	info menu.  This will go when Arlo give

2000-09-20  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-location-bar.c: (real_activate),
	(nemo_location_bar_initialize_class): Wired
	up the location bar such that when it is swapped in
	its text field gets keyboard focus, just like the
	search fields.

2000-09-20  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nemo-view/nemo-summary-view.c
	: (generate_summary_form):

	Fixed several annoying gtk bugs while drawing boxes in the tables.

2000-09-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	Finally fixed bug 1994; in the process I think I also ended up
	fixing 2576, 2577, 2578, 2579 and 2580.

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter-embed-strategy.h,
	components/adapter/nemo-adapter-embed-strategy.c: Abstract

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter-progressive-load-strategy.c
	(nemo_adapter_progressive_load_strategy_load_location): Fixed
	incorrect GnomeVFSFIleInfo handling and removed a printf.

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter-stream-load-strategy.c:
	(nemo_adapter_stream_load_strategy_load_location,
	nemo_adapter_stream_load_strategy_stop_loading): Removed print
	statements.

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter.c:
	(nemo_adapter_destroy): Free stuff.

	(nemo_adapter_new): Use the new embed strategy stuff.
	
	(nemo_adapter_open_location_callback): callback for signal
	handler attached to embed strategy.

	* src/nemo-view-frame-bonobo-control.c,
	src/nemo-view-frame-bonobo-embeddable.c: Removed.
	* src/nemo-view-frame-private.h, src/Makefile.am: Remove
	mentions of the two preceding files.

2000-09-20  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-location-bar.c: (drag_data_received_callback),
	(drag_data_get_callback): Fixed bug that happens when you drag the
	"Location:" part of the location bar. I still think the feature is
	of questionable value, but it was easy to fix it to keep it
	working. The bug resulted from making assumptions about the widget
	hierarchy.

2000-09-20  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug that was preventing Show Properties from working.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c: (cache_icon_new):
	Allow NULL for details to mean default details; keeps the fallback
	icon code simpler.
	(set_theme): A little more simplification.
	(load_icon_for_scaling): Fix the fallback icon to create the cache
	icon with cache_icon_new instead of rolling its own.

	* libnemo-extensions/bonobo-stream-vfs.c (vfs_read): Handle

2000-09-20  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/help/help-method.c: (shell_quote),
	(help_uri_to_string): Moved the shell quote function in here
	instead of trying to share the one in libnemo-extensions. This
	fixes bug 3163 (Nemo crashes any time a help item in the
	sidebar pane is double-clicked).

2000-09-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter-progressive-load-strategy.c
	(nemo_adapter_progressive_load_strategy_destroy): Fix
	unuinitialized variable use (thanks to Will LaShell).

2000-09-20  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	More work towards fixing bug 1994; in the process I think I might
	also end up fixing 2576, 2577, 2578 and 2579 (might also end up
	fixing 2580 later).
	
	* components/adapter/Makefile.am:

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter-load-strategy.h,

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter-progressive-load-strategy.h,
	components/adapter/nemo-adapter-progressive-load-strategy.c:
	Concrete subclass for loading a component that has the
	Bonobo::ProgressiveDataSink interface.

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter-stream-load-strategy.c,
	components/adapter/nemo-adapter-stream-load-strategy.h:
	Concrete subclass for loading a component that has the

	components/adapter/nemo-adapter.c:
	(nemo_adapter_destroy, nemo_adapter_new,

	* libnemo-extensions/bonobo-stream-vfs.c (vfs_read): Minor
	formatting correction.

2000-09-20  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* components/music/nemo-music-view.c: (play_current_file):
	fixed bug 2374, music view crashes when attempting to play non-local
	files, by checking for non-local files and putting up a dialog instead.
	
	* src/nemo-property-browser.c: (ensure_uri_is_image),
	(emblem_image_file_changed), (add_background_to_browser):
	fixed bug 3173, adding an svg background fails, by checking for it
	and not permitting it. Also made a few clean-ups.  We still need to
	be more robust when non-images get places in ~/.nemo/backgrounds,
	which I'll work on soon.
	
2000-09-19  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c (set_theme):
	Fixed an uninitialized variable use and cleaned up some nearby
	logic while I was at it.

	* src/nemo-main.c (main): Removed a gratuitous puts call.

2000-09-19  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-object.c:
	(eazel_install_emit_delete_files_default):

	Since the default delete_files signal is the last called in the
	bootstrap installer (which kinda sucks), it should always return
	TRUE.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-rpm-glue.c:
	(eazel_install_download_packages),
	(eazel_install_start_transaction_make_rpm_argument_list):

	Don't always assume we're downgrading.  Make sure "--oldpackage"
	flag is passed to RPM when we are.
	
	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/trilobite-core-utils.c
	: (trilobite_setenv):
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-glib-extensions.c:
	(nemo_setenv):

	Fix "=" bug in setenv.
	
	* nemo-installer/src/installer.c: (eazel_installer_do_install),
	(eazel_installer_initialize):
	* nemo-installer/src/main.c:
	* nemo-installer/src/prescript:

	Set default CGI path for remote services (in the bootstrap
	installer) and make a command-line option for setting it.  Remove
	outdated /var stuff from the prescript.
	
2000-09-19  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_receive_dropped_icons):
	doh, forgot to commit. This fixes a uninitialized variable.

2000-09-19  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c: (set_theme):
	fixed recently introduced bug where it would only use icons
	from the default theme.  Fixed by flipping the sense of a
	comparison in set_theme.
	
2000-09-19  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1860 (Switching to complex search bar leaves
	navigation bar too tall forever)

	I never did fully figure out what was wrong, but I found
	a workaround, and added a FIXME (bug 3171) about the fact 
	that the need for the workaround isn't well-understood.

	* src/nemo-switchable-navigation-bar.c:
	(nemo_switchable_navigation_bar_set_mode):
	* src/nemo-switchable-search-bar.c:
	(nemo_switchable_search_bar_set_mode):
	Added gtk_widget_queue_resize calls on the GNOME_DOCK
	ancestor of the navigation bar and search bar when the
	contents are swapped.

2000-09-19  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	added a new theme for the classic GNOME icons, and changed the
	default document icons to the ones from the eazel theme that can
	display embedded text.  This is a step on the way toward finishing
	the default theme.  I think Darin's recent check-in broke the
	icon factory so it only displays icons from the default theme; I'll
	try to fix that soon.
	
	* configure.in:
	added new gnome theme folder
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	added the document icons from the eazel theme to the default theme
	* icons/eazel/Makefile.am:
	removed the document icons from the eazel theme since it now
	inherits theme from the default theme
	* icons/eazel/i-regular.xml:
	removed the document xml file from the eazel theme 
	* icons/i-regular.xml:
	added the document xml file to the default theme
	
	* icons/gnome/.cvsignore:
	* icons/gnome/Makefile.am:
	* icons/gnome/gnome.xml:
	added new gnome theme for the classic gnome look, for people who
	prefer it.
	
2000-09-19  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3157 (Going to a bogus URI crashes nemo).
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-async.c:
	(nemo_directory_async_state_changed): Add a ref/unref to keep
	the directory around even if call_when_ready results in the last
	ref to the directory going away.

2000-09-19  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 640 (icon cache never frees images (awaiting GdkPixbuf
	fix)). Also took care of bug 3146 (zillions of 'main_loops !=
	NULL' assertion failures when quitting) and bug 3138 (Some code in
	the icon factory is cut and pasted from elsewhere). And a few
	unrelated things that came up while I was busy working on these.

	* configure.in: Applied patch from Dan Winship to fix handling of
	CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. Fixes some missing quoting and other mistakes.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/Makefile.am:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory-private.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-thumbnails.c:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-thumbnails.h:
	Broke out the thumbnailing code into its own source file for
	clarity.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory.c:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-utilities.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-utilities.c:
	(nemo_make_directory_and_parents):
	Moved nemo_make_directory_and_parents into a place where the
	thumbnail code can share it instead of requiring its own copy.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-global-preferences.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-global-preferences.c:
	(destroy_global_prefs_dialog), (global_preferences_get_dialog),

	(nemo_global_preferences_initialize):
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-preferences.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-preferences.c:
	(preferences_initialize_if_needed), (preferences_shutdown):
	* src/nemo-application.c: (nemo_application_destroy):
	Changed code so that it cleans up with g_atexit instead of with an
	explicit shutdown call. This makes it sequence correctly with
	other atexit code.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(nemo_icon_canvas_item_destroy),
	(nemo_icon_canvas_item_set_attach_points),
	(emblem_layout_next):
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c:
	(nemo_icon_container_update_icon):
	Added a Nemo prefix to the EmblemAttachPoints typedef, since
	it's public.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c:
	Changed the icon factory structure so that it will actually free
	pixbufs when done with them. Made some other small fixes to the
	icon factory in passing, including removing some redundant code
	and fixing the logic for getting custom icons and deleting the
	icon factory and g_atexit time.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (play_file), (preview_sound):
	Restructured the logic for playing sound previews a little to get
	rid of compiler warnings and close some loopholes in the old code.
	
	* src/nemo-main.c: (is_event_loop_needed),
	(quit_if_in_main_loop), (nemo_gtk_main_quit_all),
	(event_loop_unregister), (nemo_main_event_loop_register),
	(nemo_main_is_event_loop_mainstay),
	(nemo_main_event_loop_quit), (main): Fixed the main loop
	quitting logic so that it is a bit simpler and works with the
	gnome-vfs code that runs event handling after the last main loop
	is gone.

2000-09-19  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2519 (fix hideous queue_size_request hack)
	
	* src/nemo-complex-search-bar.c: (fewer_options_callback):
	It turns out that this most vile of lines was totally
	unnecessary, so I deleted it.

2000-09-19  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/summary/nemo-view/nemo-summary-view.c
	: (authn_cb_succeeded), (login_button_cb), (logout_button_cb),
	(logged_in_callback), (logged_out_callback):

	Removed the evil gtk_main_iteration crap so that the logged in state
	is much more reliable.  Hooked up the logout button to do the right thing.

2000-09-19  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	First cut at speeding up background drawing. Images now scaled
	with interpolation and image drawing is faster.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-background.c:
	(ensure_image_scaled), (nemo_background_image_fully_obscures),
	(nemo_background_draw), (nemo_art_rgb),
	(nemo_art_rgb_rgba), (nemo_draw_pixbuf_to_canvasbuf),
	(draw_pixbuf_centered_aa), (draw_pixbuf_tiled_aa),
	(nemo_background_draw_aa), (load_image_callback):

2000-09-19  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	: (generate_startup_form), (generate_summary_form),
	(authn_cb_succeeded), (authn_cb_failed), (am_i_logged_in),
	(preferences_button_cb):

	Fixed view so that it queries ammonite for its current login state
	and the login table is not drawn in a user is already logged in.

2000-09-19  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/image-viewer/io-png.c: (image_save): Use volatile to
	fix setjmp/longjmp vulnerability that was indicated by a GCC
	warning. For some reason this showed up only with new versions of
	lbpng.

2000-09-19  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1244 (Nemo window size is hardwired)
	Fixed bug 2870 (Windows are too tall for 1024x480 screen of
	Vaio C1XD picturebook)
	Fixed bug 3025 (Can't shrink window smaller than large initial size)

	* src/nemo-window.c: 
	Added #defines for window minimum and default width & height.

	(get_max_forced_height), (get_max_forced_width): New helper
	functions, broken out of nemo_window_size_request, that
	return the maximum dimensions a window should be programatically
	forced to. They return 90% of the screen width/height.
	
	(set_initial_window_geometry): New function, broken out of
	nemo_window_constructed. Uses #defines and 
	get_max_forced_width/height to determine initial and minimum
	window sizes. Set policy so that user can stretch window smaller,
	but only down to sensible minimum size.
	(nemo_window_constructed): call set_initial_window_geometry.
	(nemo_window_size_request): call get_max_forced_width/height.

2000-09-19  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-lib-self-check-functions.h:
	fixed build problem where someone apparently deleted nemo-queue
	without deleting its self check function.  Fixed by deleting the check.
	
	* components/music/mpg123_handler.c: (start_playing_file):
	fixed bug 2262, nemo doesn't play variable bit rate mp3s properly, by
	adding the "-y" parameter to the mpg123 invocation, as suggested to me
	by Jamie Manley in email.  This might also have fixed bug 2227, but I
	don't have vbr files to test with.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (play_file):
	added the "-y" parameter to mpg123 invocations to play variable bit
	rate files better.  Also, fixed bug 2529 by checking for non-local
	files and not trying to play them.
	
2000-09-19  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3019, renaming special icons should be
	impossible or harmless.

	You can't rename any NemoLinks now.  This makes
	sense given the way we use them.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_can_rename):
	Add a check to see if file is NemoLink.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: 
	(special_link_in_selection):
	Check and see if selection contains link files.
	
	(fm_icon_view_create_selection_context_menu_items):
	Call above funcion and disable rename if it returns TRUE.
	
2000-09-18  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	Fix bugzilla.eazelc.om 674 2052

	* components/services/summary/nemo-view/nemo-summary-view.c
	: (authn_cb_succeeded), (login_button_cb):

	Added a gtk_main_iteration to block for the corba callback so that
	login will wait until it gets a return value.  The summary view
	actually works now but is still pretty unreliable and throws lots
	of warnings.

2000-09-18  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	string.
	
2000-09-18  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 558 (Rubber-band selection of files in icon
	view gradually degrades)

	Now the menu-updating code does not run while rubberband
	selecting (but does run immediately thereafter).

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c:
	(start_rubberbanding), (stop_rubberbanding),
	(nemo_icon_container_initialize_class): New signals

	just when you'd expect.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h:
	Prototypes for new functions (intended to be called only
	by subclasses) fm_directory_view_start_batching_selection_changes
	and fm_directory_view_stop_batching_selection_changes.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	Added details fields: guint batching_selection_level,
	gboolean selection_changed_while_batched, gboolean
	menu_states_untrustworthy
	(selection_contains_one_item_in_menu_callback),
	(selection_not_empty_in_menu_callback): New helper functions
	that report if the selection matches expectations and complain
	via g_warning if they don't match and we trust the menu state.
	(open_callback), (trash_callback), (duplicate_callback), 
	(create_link_callback),	(open_properties_window_callback):
	Use these new helper functions to verify that the menu state
	matches expectations but not crash if it doesn't.

	(fm_directory_view_start_batching_selection_changes): Increment
	the batching level counter.
	(fm_directory_view_stop_batching_selection_changes): Decrement

2000-09-18  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2243 (trash window name should be "Trash"
	with a capital T, localized)

	that's used to get the name from directories that aren't
	vfs directories. Default implementation returns the scheme.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:

	* AUTHORS: Gave credit where credit was due.

	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(fm_search_list_view_initialize_class),

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_destroy), (update_menus_idle_callback),
	(update_one_menu_item), (schedule_update_menus):
	Partial fix to bug 558- draging to select files gradually degrades.
	Turns out to be a bonobo bug. For now tweaked the way the menu updating
	code gets called to make it get called less to make the bug less visible.
	
2000-09-18  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-search-uri.c:
	(nemo_self_check_search_uri): fix bug 2378.
	This was waaaay tougher than I expected: the translation 
	strings were actually good. The code did an evil cast between 
	2 slightly different structures which ended in strange 
	behaviour. Added a test for this. Thanks a lot Rebecca.

2000-09-18  Josh Barrow  <linuxfan@ionet.net>

	* README:
	Remove instances of gtkhtml as it isn't required any longer.

	Clean up whitespace on XML files for the pathetic libxml library,
	so it won't puke.  Add the hacky gnome-vfs env variable to set the
	user-agent string for fetching the XML file.

2000-09-17  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_receive_dropped_icons):

	the actual file operation. ie: bug 3085
	* test/Makefile.am: add brand new test I used in my quest for bug
	1963
	* test/test-nemo-background.c: (main): the actual test :)
	run and you will see beautiful background.

2000-09-17  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	More work towards bug 1994. I'm not yet checking in the code to
	actually use the adapter yet, but it sort of works on my system.
	
	* nemo-clean.sh: Added nemo-adapter

	* components/adapter/main.c (main): Do the stop in debugger
	trick. Also, initialize gnome-vfs (and threads). Duh!
	
	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter-factory-server.c
	(impl_Nemo_ComponentAdapterFactory_create_adapter):
	CORBA_Object_duplicate the object reference we return, because
	CORBA's just cool like that.
	
	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter.c
	(nemo_adapter_new): Show me the widgets, Lebowski. That's
	right, a few missing gtk_widget_show calls were the only bugs in
	this hairy mess of CORBA/Bonobo code (well, other than the obvious
	resource leaks).
	
	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter.oafinfo: Updated to match
	reality.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c
	(vfs_file_exists, nemo_make_directory_and_parents,

	check_for_thumbnails): Put FIXMEs for a bunch of synchronous I/O
	that is making it a pain in the ass to test 1994.

	* src/nemo-component-adapter-factory.c:
	Fill in the right IID.
	(nemo_component_adapter_factory_initialize): Allocate the details.
	(nemo_component_adapter_factory_create_adapter): Return the
	actual adapted view, not CORBA_OOBJECT_BIL (hello?).

	* src/nemo-main.c (main): Add "ORBit" log domain to ones that
	stop in the debugger.
	
2000-09-17  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	fixed bug 2319, "Find" and "Web Search" shouldn't have the same icon.  Fixed by

	toolbar code to properly fetch them using the theme routines.
	
	* icons/Makefile.am:
	* icons/SearchWeb.png:
	added web search icon done by Susan in the standard style
	
	* icons/eazel/Makefile.am:

	passed in target doesn't have one.
	* src/nemo-window-toolbars.c: (set_up_button),
	(set_up_toolbar_images):
	use theme-based image fetching when setting up the toolbar images

	claenup the code. make it more readable (hopefully although
	I am less than hopeful).

2000-09-16  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2450, We don't detect zip drives, etc.

	I added all filesystem types listed in man fstab and
	others that I found by reading various linux articles.
	There may be even more!  We can test these for now.

	mime-type.

	factory lifecycle management purposes.

	* components/adapter/nemo-adapter.h,
	components/adapter/nemo-adapter.c: Initial implementation of
	class that does the actual adapting. For now, it only handles
	Embeddables that take input via PersistStream. Later I will apply
	the Strategy pattern to virtualize visual embedding (Control
	vs. Embeddable) and loading (PersistStream vs. PersistFile
	vs. ProgressiveDataSink) (and fix some missing bits in the
	embedding virtualization).

	* components/adapter/Makefile.am: Build the new files.

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-rpm-glue.c:

2000-09-15  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2194, no scrollbars in image view
	Fixed bug 2215, image viewer needs to erase background
	when loading image.

	I fixed these bugs by writing a new image component.  Is this bad?
	I don't know.  What is bad is the current state of the EOG bonobo
	component.  I don't think it is worth our time to fix it right now.
	This component will also support the zoomable interface when
	Maciej finishes the work there. It is doubtful the EOG bonobo
	component would have a Nemo specific dependency.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-global-preferences.h:
	define NEMO_PREFERENCES_CONFIRM_TRASH and 
	NEMO_PREFERENCES_SHOW_BACKUP_FILES.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-global-preferences.c:
	(global_preferences_create_dialog): Put these two new preferences
	on the Directory Views page; rename it Folder Views.
	(global_preferences_register): Register default values for new
	preferences.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-preferences-dialog.c:
	Increase initial height of window to account for new preferences.
	There's an open bug about reorganizing the whole window for later.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-operations.c:

	account.
	(file_name_from_uri): New helper routine to save a little code
	duplication.
	(fm_directory_view_confirm_deletion): Use yes_no dialog instead
	of simple dialog to match other usage; improve dialog title.
	(confirm_delete_from_trash): New function, confirms deleting
	items from trash unless preference says not to bother.
	(fm_directory_view_trash_or_delete_files): Call 
	confirm_delete_from_trash before deleting items from trash.
	(compute_menu_item_info): Do or don't add ellipses to "Empty Trash"
	and "Delete From Trash" depending on preference setting.
	(schedule_update_menus_callback): New function, simple wrapper for
	schedule_update_menus (called when CONFIRM_TRASH preference changes).
	(filtering_changed_callback): Renamed and slightly generalized from
	show_hidden_files_changed_callback, called when either the
	SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES or SHOW_BACKUP_FILES preference changes.

2000-09-15  Eli Goldberg  <eli@eazel.com>

2000-09-15  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2362 (Selecting "Add Bookmark" while loading a web

	* src/nemo-window-menus.c:
	(nemo_window_add_bookmark_for_current_location): Removed
	incorrect assert comparing window->location and 
	window->current_location_bookmark. These can be out of synch
	here due to the evils of the state machine, but this function
	will be OK. Also, removed logic preventing adding multiple
	bookmarks for the same location, since it (A) doesn't match the
	behavior of other browsers; (B) might be annoying if you want
	to add several identical bookmarks and then hand-tweak them in
	the Edit Bookmarks window; (C) might be confusing if you don't
	notice the existing bookmark in the menu; and (D) won't make 
	sense when we fully support hierarchical bookmarks.

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(check_last_bookmark_location_matches_window):
	Updated the comments on this debugging function, and changed
	its behavior from g_warning to g_error since the only known
	reasons for it complaining have recently been fixed.

	* icons/Makefile.am:
	removed icons/druid_welcome.png image, since it's no longer used

2000-09-15  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Another try at fixing the Tinderbox.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Removed files that are not in Makefile.am,
	since they won't be in the tarball/RPM.
	
	* check-POTFILES.pl: Added a new script to check for files that
	are mentioned in POTFILES.in, but not in the Makefile.am files.
	* check-headers-in-Makefile.pl: Fixed to use SUBDIRS instead of

	(user_level_manager_get_user_level_as_string): Split array of
	user level names & list that's made from it into two; one for
	gconf setting strings and one for user display. The user display
	one is marked for translation. Made "get_user_level_string"
	private since it had no callers and it's used only for the gconf
	manipulation (and it would have a confusing name if public).
	Changed _get_user_level_names to _get_user_level_name_for_display
	and made it return a single name rather than the whole set;
	that's how callers were using it anyway.
	
	* src/nemo-first-time-druid.c:

	auto-scrolls, but shouldn't)
	Fixed bug 2612 (Part of icon view drawn in black when

2000-09-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3043 (clicking on broken symbolic link tries
	to execute it).

	Now clicking on it brings up a dialog telling the user
	about the missing target file and asking whether they
	want to throw the link away. Also, I changed the type
	string for link files to be "link to <whatever>" instead
	of just "<whatever>", and "link (broken)" for broken ones.

2000-09-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* components/rpmview/Makefile.am:
	* components/tree/Makefile.am:
	* libnemo-extensions/Makefile.am:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	Added missing .h files.
	
	* src/file-manager/.cvsignore:
	Ignore some ancient generated files.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gtk-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gtk_label_make_bold): Formatting tweak.
	(nemo_gtk_widget_set_foreground_color): Don't set the base
	color when you set the foreground. The base is more like the
	background color.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-volume-monitor.c:
	(mnttab_add_mount_volume): Formatting tweak.

2000-09-14  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	To get started on a bug, I dismantled part of the state machine,
	which we can replace with something much simpler. Just doing this
	change seems to have fixed the bug I was going to tackle.

	Fixes bug 2170 (hitting the "up" button a lot of times in a row
	causes crash).

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-utilities.c:
	(nemo_self_check_file_utilities): Quick tweak to these tests.
	We need more thorough tests of nemo_make_uri_from_input.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-search-bar-criterion-private.h:
	Removed this long-obsolete file. There's another copy in the src
	directory that's the "real" one.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_destroy): Fixed a problem I was seeing
	switching out of the list view by emptying the "pending" lists so
	doing the stop as part of destroy will not add items to the view
	before destroying it.
	
	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_free_load_info): Got rid of "action_tag",
	"made_changes", and "state".
	(nemo_window_update_state): Turned "made_changes" into a local
	variable. Got rid of code setting "state" since nothing looked at
	it. Got rid of code that sets up an idle.
	(nemo_window_set_state_info): Eliminated "do_sync" and made
	the function always keep running update_state until it's done
	instead of using an idle.
	(nemo_window_end_location_change_callback): Got rid of FIXME
	since I now understand why gtk_object_destroy is OK for windows.
	
	* src/nemo-window.h: Eliminated "action_tag", "made_changes",
	and "state".
	
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_destroy): No need to
	deal with "action_tag" any more.
	(window_update_sidebar_panels_from_preferences): Remove excess
	unref that's not needed now that we have more careful handling of
	sidebar references.

2000-09-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3072 (crash right-clicking in icon view background)

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (compute_menu_item_info):
	Fixed mistake in assert. *return_name != NULL should have
	been return_name != NULL. This caused an intermittent assertion
	failure (reproducible for some people).

2000-09-14  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 3071 (zoom control right-click menu doesn't work)

	The recent change from doubles to floats broke this, because
	some function pointers had been cast to gpointer so that the
	compiler didn't notice that they were casting CORBA_float to 
	CORBA_double.

	* libnemo/nemo-zoomable.c:
	(impl_Nemo_Zoomable__get_zoom_level),
	(impl_Nemo_Zoomable__set_zoom_level),
	(impl_Nemo_Zoomable__get_min_zoom_level),

	(impl_Nemo_Zoomable__get_is_continuous),

	(impl_Nemo_Zoomable_zoom_in),
	(impl_Nemo_Zoomable_zoom_out),
	(impl_Nemo_Zoomable_zoom_to_fit),
	(impl_Nemo_Zoomable__destroy):
	Removed (gpointer) function casts by passing parameters
	of the required type and casting them inside each function.
	Then changed CORBA_double to CORBA_float wherever it was
	used.
	
	* src/nemo-zoom-control.c: (create_zoom_menu_item):
	Changed menu items in zoom control popup to use the
	"always show toggle" style like all of our other
	toggleable menu items.

	Merging startup and summary into a single view. Deleted the original

	rewritten.

	uninstall or revert actually return a fail condition.  Clean up
	possible warning debug messages (read from rpm pipe).
	
Wed Sep 13 22:06:55 2000  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-druid.c
	  (nemo_druid_size_request):  After some investigation found that
	  fixme (#2553) was complete bollocks, so I removed it.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c (nemo_file_get_uri):
	  Apparently my current alpha compiler (egcs 1.1.2) is now more
	  sensitive to uninitialized vars.  This one is harmless, since there
	  was a g_assert_not_reached for the case where it's uninited.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-scalable-font.c (invert_glyph),
	  librsvg/test-ft-gtk.c (invert_glyph):
	  YAIKES! casting to to (int) to get artithmetic.  Changed to (long)
	  but that's still Wrong(tm)

	* src/nemo-sidebar-tabs.c: (draw_tab_piece_aa):
	fixed bug 2983, sidebar tabs don't handle missing images well, by
	checking for a null pixbuf in draw_tab_piece_aa.
	
2000-09-13  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed uninitialized variable problems found by compiling with -O
	on. Thanks to Michael Meeks for pointing these out.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_or_measure_label_text_aa): Added some otherwise-gratuitous
	code that will make the uninitialized-variable warning quiet down.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-volume-monitor.c:
	(nemo_volume_monitor_mount_unmount_removable): Added some
	otherwise-gratuitous code that will make the
	uninitialized-variable warning quiet down.
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: (insert_one_context_menu_item):
	Initialize a variable even in the "not reached" case.
	* src/nemo-switchable-search-bar.c: (real_activate): Moved the
	default "not reached" case so that when asserts are off we don't
	have an uninitialized variable bug.

2000-09-13  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed the ref. count problem that was causing crash on startup
	with sidebar panels on. Sorry, I was a bit careless with my
	earlier check-in.

	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_add_sidebar_panel),
	(nemo_window_remove_sidebar_panel): Keep a reference to a sidebar
	panel as long as it's in the sidebar panel list.
	(window_update_sidebar_panels_from_preferences): Got rid of an extra
	ref in this code that's no longer needed.

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_has_really_changed): Turned sidebars back on.
	(report_sidebar_panel_failure_to_user): Added _() around some strings
	that require translation.
	(nemo_window_update_state): Used nemo_gtk_object_list_free to
	save some code.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(get_id_from_digit_string): Made this function simpler by using
	a local variable instead of g_new.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-glib-extensions.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-glib-extensions.c:
	(nemo_setenv), (nemo_unsetenv): Renamed to get rid of the
	gratuitous g prefix. Also fixed some comments to be more accurate.
	Added a prototype for a shell escape function -- haven't written
	the function yet, but I will shortly.
	
	* src/nemo-first-time-druid.c:
	(next_proxy_configuration_page_callback), (set_http_proxy),
	(attempt_http_proxy_autoconfigure): Take out some g_message calls
	and use the nemo_setenv call by its new name.
	* src/nemo-main.c: (main): Use nemo_unsetenv by the new name.
	* src/nemo-shell.c: (corba_restart): Use nemo_setenv by
	the new name.
	
2000-09-13  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-zoom-control.c: (draw_number):
	fixed bug 2181, number in zoom control is left justified at first.
	Fixed by using the widget->allocation.width in the centering
	calculation, instead of the passed-in box width.
	
2000-09-13  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_has_really_changed):
	Temporarily disabled sidebar panels so that Nemo doesn't crash
	on startup. Darin or Maciej will need to do a real fix.

2000-09-13  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	More work on tree view UI issues.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-ctree.c:
	(nemo_ctree_class_init), (nemo_ctree_init),
	(nemo_ctree_event), (nemo_ctree_draw_expander),
	(nemo_ctree_draw_node):
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-ctree.h:

2000-09-13  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	Added a fixme + misc cleanup while investigating
	bugs 3022 and 3038
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-background.c:
	(nemo_background_set_image_uri_no_emit),
	(nemo_background_set_image_uri),
	(nemo_background_receive_dropped_background_image):
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-background.c:
	(nemo_directory_background_read_desktop_settings),
	(nemo_directory_background_event_filter):

2000-09-13  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2916 "Shouldn't be able to create new items in trash."

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_is_in_trash): Made this return TRUE for the trash
	itself.

2000-09-13  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_get_string_attribute_with_default),
	(nemo_file_get_top_left_text): Unmark strings that are
	unlikely candidates for localization at the request of one of the
	translators (menthos).
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_or_measure_label_text), (draw_or_measure_label_text_aa):
	Move line break characters into a separate string constant, in
	part to make the comment about why it's localizable appear in the
	pot file.

	(directory_contents_value_field_update): Unmark strings that are
	unlikely candidates for localization at the request of one of the

2000-09-13  J Shane Culpepper  <pepper@eazel.com>

	* components/services/nemo-dependent-shared/icons/Makefile.am:
	* components/services/summary/nemo-view/nemo-summary-view.c
	: (generate_summary_form), (generate_service_entry_row),
	(generate_eazel_news_entry_row), (generate_update_news_entry_row),
	(maintenance_button_cb):

	More work on the summary view xml voodoo.  Still a few more problems
	but getting close to complete.

2000-09-13  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bugs in Nemo link management, some other minor problems
	I encountered along the way, and did the first cut at a state
	machine for NemoViewFrame based on Maciej's design that can
	mostly replace the super-complicated one for NemoWindow.

	* README: We no longer can use the ORBit that comes with HC1.2
	with cvs HEAD, since warnings have been fixed in the code
	generated by the newer ORBit, so fix that line in the README.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory.c:
	(nemo_directory_new): Use the new nemo_uri_is_trash
	function to avoid hard-coding incorrect checks for "trash:".
	(nemo_directory_copy_move_metadata_key): Make simple fix for
	empty metadata. This code gets replaced soon anyway.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-drag.c:
	(nemo_drag_can_accept_item): Simplify code to get rid of
	illegal sync. I/O. It's OK to assume all NemoLink objects
	point to directories for now, and if we make a change to do
	something fancier later, we have to do it with async.
	(nemo_drag_default_drop_action_for_icons): Use the new
	nemo_uri_is_trash function to avoid hard-coding incorrect
	checks for "trash:".
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-drag.h: Fixed a typo.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-operations.c:
	(get_link_name): Fix unintialized variable warning in a simple
	way that avoids adding too much code.
	(get_duplicate_name): Fix unintialized variable warning in a
	simple way that avoids adding too much code.
	(nemo_file_operations_copy_move): Use the new
	nemo_uri_is_trash function to avoid hard-coding incorrect
	checks for "trash:".

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-utilities.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-utilities.c:
	(nemo_uri_is_trash): Add new function to avoid hard-coding
	incorrect checks for "trash:".
	(nemo_make_uri_canonical), Use nemo_uri_is_trash.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c:
	Remove nemo_icon_container_trash_link_is_in_selection for 3
	reasons. It doesn't belong in NemoIconContainer, the use of it
	in drag code was incorrectly looking at the destination
	directory's selection, and it used sync. I/O.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-dnd.c:
	(selection_includes_trash),
	(nemo_icon_container_receive_dropped_icons):
	Changed code to actually check selection -- the old code would
	check the selection in the target window. Unfortunately this still
	uses sync. I/O, but that's now covered by bug 3020.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c:
	(nemo_icon_factory_get_icon_for_file): Change to use new
	"local" API for links to make it clear that it uses sync. I/O and
	only works on local files.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-link.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-link.c: (get_tag),
	(get_link_type): Added functions to handle tags internally as part
	of getting rid of tag string values from the API.
	(nemo_link_local_create): Changed name to local to emphasize this
	takes a path not a URI and uses sync. I/O.
	(local_set_root_property): Share code among the set
	functions. Before there were a lot of copies of the same
	code. Also made sure that it does no rewrite of the file if called
	to set a property to the same value it already has.
	(nemo_link_local_set_icon),
	(nemo_link_local_set_link_uri),
	(nemo_link_local_set_type): Changed name to local to emphasize
	these take a path not a URI and use sync. I/O.  Reimplement by
	calling local_set_root_property.
	(nemo_link_local_get_additional_text): Change name to local
	and make it take a path instead of a URI to make it clear it uses
	sync.  I/O and doesn't work on remote URIs.
	(nemo_link_local_get_image_uri): Change name to local and make
	it take a path instead of a URI to make it clear it uses sync.
	I/O and doesn't work on remote URIs.
	(nemo_link_local_get_link_uri): Change name to local and make
	it take a path instead of a URI to make it clear it uses sync.
	I/O and doesn't work on remote URIs.
	(nemo_link_local_get_link_type): Change return value to be the
	NemoLinkType enum instead of the type tag string to make the
	interface cleaner. Also changed name to local to make it clear
	that it takes a path instead of a URI and uses sync. I/O.
	(nemo_link_local_is_volume_link),
	(nemo_link_local_is_home_link),
	(nemo_link_local_is_trash_link): Changed all three of these to
	take advantage of the new simpler get_link_type, and changed name
	to local to make it clear that they take a path instead of a URI
	and use sync. I/O.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c: (create_mount_link):
	Use call by new "local" name.
	(trash_link_is_selection): Call new "local" function, which now
	requires a path rather than a URI.
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_trash_state_changed_callback): Use call by
	new "local" name.
	(volume_unmounted_callback): Fix bug where the unmounted callback
	was using a path as a URI without converting.
	(find_and_update_home_link): Use call by new "local" name.
	(place_home_directory): Use call by new "local" name.
	(find_and_rename_trash_link): Use call by new "local" name.
	(create_or_rename_trash): Use call by new "local" name.
	(remove_old_mount_links): Use call by new "local" name.
	(get_sort_category): Use new get_link_type call and a case
	statement instead of the old one and a list of string compares.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_trash_link_in_selection): Wrote a new version of
	this function. This is similar to what was in
	NemoIconContainer, but the one in there didn't belong there,
	and didn't really work for other callers. Also, the one in there
	didn't work at all for the list view case. This new function works
	for either icon or list view. It still has the limitation that it
	won't recognize a trash link if it's not local.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c:
	(get_icon_drop_target_uri_callback): Fix to use new local calls, but
	still does sync. I/O. Bug 3020 reported about that.
	(get_icon_text_callback): Changed to use new local calls. Still a
	problem that it works only locally and uses sync. I/O. Bug 2531 was
	already reported about that.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c:
	(get_and_ref_file_to_display): Changed to use new local calls and the
	simpler link type interface.
	
	* src/nemo-view-frame-private.h: Moved some private
	declarations here since they are for objects used in one file and
	declared in another.
	
	* src/nemo-view-frame.h:
	* src/nemo-view-frame.c: (nemo_view_frame_destroy_client):
	Destroy the "check if view is gone" timeout here; makes more sense
	than the way it was managed before.
	(nemo_view_frame_destroy): Don't destroy the timeout here any
	more. Also, label was moved into details.
	(nemo_view_frame_handle_client_gone): Renamed from
	handle_client_destroy_2.
	(view_frame_wait), (view_frame_underway),
	(view_frame_wait_is_over), (view_frame_loaded),
	(view_frame_failed): Added functions to implement view frame state
	machine transitions.
	(check_if_view_is_gone): Moved code to check if view is gone here;
	it's now activated automatically without requiring an explicit
	call to turn it on, since all callers were turning it on at
	load_client time.
	(nemo_view_frame_load_client): Add state management. Moved the
	code to turn on the object check timeout here.
	(nemo_view_frame_load_location): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_open_location): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_open_location_in_new_window): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_open_in_new_window_and_select): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_report_location_change): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_report_selection_change): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_report_status): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_report_load_underway): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_report_load_progress): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_report_load_complete): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_report_load_failed): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_set_title): Add state management.
	(nemo_view_frame_zoom_level_changed): Add state management.,
	(nemo_view_frame_get_label), (nemo_view_frame_set_label):
	Moved label into details structure.
	
	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_load_sidebar_panel): Fixed code structure a bit
	(fixes bug 2463) and got rid of call to old
	nemo_view_frame_set_active_errors function, which is no longer
	needed.
	(nemo_window_load_content_view): Got rid of call to old
	nemo_view_frame_set_active_errors function, which is no longer
	needed.
	* src/nemo-window.c:
	(window_update_sidebar_panels_from_preferences): Got rid of call
	to old nemo_view_frame_set_active_errors function, which is no
	longer needed.

2000-09-13  Pavel Cisler <pavel@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file-operations.c:
	(icon_position_iterator_new):
	Remove an extra unescape call that worked around an escaping
	bug in the copy engine. This bug is now fixed in Gnome VFS
	and the workaround is not needed any more.

2000-09-12  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* components/rpmview/nemo-rpm-view-install.c:
	(nemo_rpm_view_finished_working),
	(nemo_rpm_view_install_done), (nemo_service_need_password),
	(nemo_service_try_again),
	(nemo_rpm_view_install_package_callback),
	(nemo_rpm_view_uninstall_package_callback):
	* components/rpmview/nemo-rpm-view-private.h:
	* components/rpmview/nemo-rpm-view.c:
	(nemo_rpm_view_destroy), (nemo_rpm_view_update_from_uri):

	Move private fields to a shared header.  Make the password query
	dialog work just like the installer's (ability to abort, stop
	trying after 3 times, etc).  Grey out install/uninstall buttons
	while working.  Clean up resources to avoid coredumps or getting
	into a screwy state.

2000-09-12  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-factory.c:
	(load_thumbnail_frame), (nemo_icon_factory_make_thumbnails):
	fixed bug 2567, thumbnail frame size hardwired, by fetching the
	frame offsets from the theme.
	* icons/default.xml:
	added thumbnail frame offsets for default frame to default theme

2000-09-12  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed part of bug 1537 (double-clicking in single-click
	mode and open-in-new-window mode opens 2 windows).

	Modes suck. Anyway, this was two separate bugs, one in
	list view and one in icon view. I fixed the list view
	one. The icon view one is more complicated, because
	there was already code to handle this case but it doesn't 
	work right, and it isn't obvious how to fix it.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-list.c:
	(nemo_list_button_press): Ignore 2nd click of
	double-click if in single-click mode.

2000-09-12  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>

	Dragging a image onto a background not clears the
	background color setting. Bug 1899.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-background.c:
	(nemo_background_set_image_uri),
	(nemo_background_receive_dropped_background_image):
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-directory-background.c:
	(saved_settings_changed_callback):

2000-09-12  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2020 (really long URIs make "can't go there"
	dialogs insanely wide)

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_end_location_change_callback): Use
	magic Ramiro truncating technology to display 
	middle-truncated URI if it's more than a certain number
	of characters wide.

2000-09-13  Ali Abdin  <aliabdin@aucegypt.edu>

	Fixed a few typos. Add in preliminary support for QUESTION/ANWSER tags
	First stab at getting book/chapter support in (Bug #2325) - It works
	as I want it to, but we may encounter bugs.

	There were a few typos here. Extended the table down all the way to
	CHAPTERS

	(toc_title_start_element),
	(toc_title_end_element),
	(toc_title_characters),
	(toc_sect_start_element): Add support for chapter tag.

	* components/help/converters/gnome-db2html2/sect-preparse.c:

	fixed bug where it couldn't expand uris containing blanks or other
	escaped characters, by calling gnome_vfs_unescape_string on the
	basename before using it for comparison.

	window wider)

	* src/nemo-window.c: 
	(install_status_bar): New function, installs status bar into

	fixed bug 2060, implement Arlo's text layout scheme, which is now 135 pixel
	instead of 80 in the standard layout mode; it's still 80 in the tighter
	layout mode.
	 
2000-09-07  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-view.c:
	Fixed a "gtk_entry_list_unref" that should
	have been a "gtk_target_list_unref"
	
2000-09-07  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Moves the tree view to the new standard way of dnd.
	This now makes it consistant with the rest of the icon
	and list view.
	Fixes a number of bugs in the process: 2897, 2905, 2353
	
	* components/tree/nemo-tree-view.c: it just changes 
	a lot of things and cleans the code. Dnd should be now fully 
	functional for file drag and drops. Please, test and report
	bugs.

2000-09-07  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* components/tree/nemo-tree-model.c
	(nemo_tree_model_directory_files_changed_callback): Look up
	the node based on the NemoFile, not the uri, since the URI may
	have changed, if we are getting a "change" signal.

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-metadata.c:
	(get_conf_string), (get_conf_int), (get_conf_boolean):

	Work around fatal API flaw in gconf, so we can detect whether

2000-09-07  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-dnd.c:
	(receive_dropped_tile_image):
	fixed bug 2896, tiled backgrounds don't work in the icon view.
	nemo_background_receive_dropped_background_image was passing the
	GtkSelectionData object, instead of the data it points to.  Mathieu
	caused this when he reworked the drag and drop stuff recently.
	
	
2000-09-07  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2218 (Duplicate items appear in history list)

	Also changed a few places to compare uris with the new
	nemo_uris_match instead of strcmp.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-bookmark.h,
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-bookmark.c:
	(nemo_bookmark_compare_with): Use nemo_uris_match.
	(nemo_bookmark_compare_uris): New function, compares
	bookmarks' uris with nemo_uris_match; ignores names.
	
	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c:
	(nemo_window_set_displayed_location), (handle_go_elsewhere),
	(open_location): Use nemo_uris_match.
	
	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_add_to_history_list):
	Use nemo_bookmark_compare_uris instead of _compare_with.
	This was the source of the bug. Due to asynchronicity introduced
	sometime after this code was written, when the bookmark for the 
	current location was created it did not	yet know what name to use, 
	and so it did not match any of the old History items that had the 
	correct name. But for the History list we only want one entry per 
	uri anyway, so it needn't have been comparing the names in the 
	first place.

2000-09-07  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	events and prelighting appropriately.
	
2000-09-07  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug causing icon view not to display trash:
	URI.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-mime-actions.c:

	(nemo_mime_get_default_component_for_uri_internal),
	(nemo_do_component_query):

2000-09-07  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

2000-09-07  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	Turn on smooth fonts in the icon view.  This is controlled by the
	SMOOTH_GRAPHICS preference.  I tried to cause a minimum amount of
	disruption to the icon-canvas-item beast.  For this reason, there
	are some serious preformance problems.  I plan to attack those
	next.

	In case of emergency, i left a life boat in there.  Just comment
	out the SMOOTH_FONTS define in the top of the file.  I expect to
	yank this out in the next day or so.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_or_measure_label_text), Teach it about the smooth fonts
	case.  (measure_label_text),  Same here.
	(draw_label_text), Here too.  (draw_or_measure_label_text_aa), New
	function to do the drawing or measuring using NemoScalableFont
	instead of GdkFont.
	(draw_label_text_aa): New function that draws the smooth text into
	a pixbuf so what we can continue to use the old rendering
	machinery.  This is the reason for at least on of the performance
	problems.  We should be able to render directly into the canvas
	item's buffer.  
	
2000-09-07  Ramiro Estrugo  <ramiro@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(nemo_icon_canvas_item_initialize_class),

	Simplify the highlight color initialization.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-scalable-font.c:

	sure the color is opaque.

2000-09-07  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-window-manage-views.c: (handle_go_elsewhere):

	De-fatalized bug 2872 (Common crash when navigating, complaint
	about last_location_bookmark not matching window->location).

	Changed an assert (fatal) to a message (annoying) to prevent
	this now very common bug from being fatal. I'll fix the real
	problem soon.

2000-09-07  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Add support for smooth fonts.  We simply manage one font and an
	array of sizes.  The management of the smooth font parallels that

	The tree view now needs some work to catch up with all those changes.
	* src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c: (fm_list_handle_dropped_icons):

	object with the object actually exposed, but maybe I should hide

	readable...)
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-rpm-glue.c:

	A small beatification.

2000-09-06  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/test-ft-gtk.c: Added "-a" option for attaching AFM
	files, used to confirm that bugzilla.eazel.com 2141 affects
	TrueType and not Type1 fonts. Also added const to filename
	argument.

	* librsvg/rsvg.c (rsvg_start_svg): Patch for bugzilla.eazel.com
	2239. If width and height are not specified in the SVG file,
	defaults are used. Previously, the creation of the pixbuf was
	failing, causing downstream code to segfault on the NULL.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-background.c:
	(nemo_background_draw_aa),

2000-09-06  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-application.c, src/nemo-shell.c: Fixed FIXME
	bugzilla.eazel.com 2535 (had to be fixed once I made the idl file

	Fixed bug 2011, Numeric keypad enter key doesn't work
	right in Search field.

	Fixed bug 2012, Undo doesn't work in search

2000-09-06  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	I almost fixed bug 2598 ("Select All Files" enabled when the
	directory is empty), only to realize at the last moment that
	there is no current API to tell whether a directory view is
	displaying any files or not (just as there is no API to tell
	the count of displayed files, which is part of the problem
	with bug 480).

	While fixing this, I changed the directory view menu-updating 
	mechanism so that the real work gets done in an idle handler 
	instead of immediately, to prevent/fix performance problems 
	caused by multiple menu	updates happening in succession. So I'm
	checking in this performance change but not yet addressing
	bug 2598 itself.

	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_destroy): remove menu-updating idle handler.
	(update_menus_idle_callback): New function, calls
	fm_directory_view_update_menus and resets idle handler id.
	(schedule_update_menus): New function, adds idle handler that
	calls update_menus_idle_callback.
	(remove_custom_icons_callback), 
	(fm_directory_view_notify_selection_changed),
	(fm_directory_view_load_uri),
	(fm_directory_view_trash_state_changed_callback),
	(fm_directory_view_real_merge_menus): schedule menu update instead
	of doing it immediately.
	(compute_menu_item_info): Add FIXME with bug 2598 here.
	(fm_directory_view_real_update_menus): Update Select All item.

000-09-06  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	* libnemo-adapter/nemo-adapter-factory.idl: New IDL
	interface for the special adapter component that will be used to
	wrap ordinary Bonobo components to look like Nemo::Views as
	part of the solution to bugzilla.eazel.com #1994.
	* libnemo-adapter/Makefile.am: Build a library containing the
	stubs and sekeletons.

	* libnemo/nemo-view-component.idl: Some changes so this
	IDL file can be included in others safely.
	* libnemo/Makefile.am: Made necessary build adjustments for
	the above.

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: add libnemo-adapter directory to
	build.
	
2000-09-06  Robin * Slomkowski  <rslomkow@eazel.com>

	* README: added requirment of BEFORE_NEW_UI_HANDLER_1
	tag for bonobo, gtkhtml, eog, xpdf

2000-09-06  Andy Hertzfeld  <andy@eazel.com>

	* src/nemo-sidebar-tabs.c: (get_tab_width):
	fixed bug 2505, scale in sidebar tabs shouldn't be hardwired.
	This was made irrelevant when we changed it to use scalable fonts
	instead of the old scaling hack, so I'm just removing the fixme.
	
2000-09-06  Raph Levien  <raph@acm.org>

	* librsvg/test-ft-gtk.c (test_ft_quit): Invoke rsvg_ft_ctx_done()
	to facilitate testing of cleanup and for checking for mem leaks.

	* librsvg/rsvg-ft.c: Actually evict glyphs when glyph cache
	becomes full. Fixed some mem leaks in rsvg_ft_ctx_done - it
	wasn't freeing everything in the context.

2000-09-06  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2816, Home icon doesn't link to changed home directory.

	Now the link is updated both at dekstop launch and whenever
	the user changed the preference in the Navigation pane of
	the preferences dialog.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c: (home_uri_changed),
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize), (find_and_update_home_link),

	fixed bug 2499, font leak in sidebar title.
	
	* icons/vector/Makefile.am:
	* icons/vector/vector.xml:
	fixed bug 2206, vector icon zoom control draws wrong, by removing
	the custom zoom control for the vector theme, which was
	experimental and not intended to stay around.

2000-09-06  Robey Pointer  <robey@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-md5.c:

2000-09-06  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1794 (New directory view background context menu design)

	Any complaints or revisions of the context menus in directory
	views should be written up as new bugs.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gtk-extensions.h,
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gtk-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gtk_menu_insert_separator): New function, slight
	generalization of _append_separator that takes a position.
	(nemo_gtk_menu_append_separator): Now calls _insert_separator.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.h: Added supports_auto_layout 
	function pointer for subclasses to optionally override.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c: 
	renamed details->updating_bonobo_marked_menu_item to
	updating_toggle_menu_item since I realized that it's not
	a Bonobo-specific problem.
	(tighter_layout_callback): updated for API changes.
	(fm_icon_view_using_auto_layout),
	(fm_icon_view_using_tighter_layout): New convenience function
	to share a little code.
	(compute_menu_item_info): Changed toggle_item boolean parameter
	to menu_item_type that returns an enum for normal, check,
	radio, and subtree items; moved some layout-related items in
	here so the context menu can avoid duplicating code.
	(context_menu_layout_radio_item_callback),
	(append_one_context_menu_layout_item): New functions, used by
	layout items in context menu. 
	(insert_one_context_menu_item): Now handles the various menu item 
	types returned by compute_menu_item_info, and returns the new item.
	(append_one_context_menu_item): Now returns the new item.
	(fm_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_items): Add the
	layout items to the context menu per bug 1794.

	virtual function.
	(real_supports_auto_layout): Returns TRUE.
	(fm_icon_view_initialize_class): Wire up supports_auto_layout.
	(update_layout_menus): Now skips some work if supports_auto_layout
	is false; also updates reversed_order item in a way that works
	even the reversed_order field was changed elsewise.
	(fm_icon_view_get_directory_sort_by),
	(fm_icon_view_set_directory_sort_by),
	(fm_icon_view_get_directory_sort_reversed),
	(fm_icon_view_set_directory_sort_reversed),
	(fm_icon_view_get_directory_auto_layout),
	(fm_icon_view_set_directory_auto_layout): Bail out early if
	supports_auto_layout is false.

	(insert_bonobo_menu_item): Handle the different menu item types
	returned by compute_menu_item_info.
	(set_sort_criterion_by_path): New function, extracted from
	sort_callback so it could be used elsewhere.
	(sort_callback): Now calls set_sort_criterion_by_path.
	(sort_direction_callback): Changed signature so it can be used
	for both Bonobo and Gtk menus; changed implementation not to
	rely on Bonobo menu state.
	(manual_layout_callback): Changed signature so it can be used
	for both Bonobo and Gtk menus
	(layout_changed_callback),  (icon_position_changed_callback): 
	Use new convenience functions.
	(fm_icon_view_merge_menus): Use insert_bonobo_menu_item for
	more items to avoid duplicating code with context menus.
	(update_one_menu_item): Updated for compute_menu_item_info API change.

	(fm_desktop_icon_view_get_directory_sort_auto_layout),
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_set_directory_sort_auto_layout): Removed
	these overridden function pointers, obviated by new
	supports_auto_layout.
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize_class): removed function
	pointer wiring for the above set; added function pointer
	wiring for supports_auto_layout.
	(real_supports_auto_layout): New function, returns FALSE.

2000-09-06  Eli Goldberg  <eli@eazel.com>

	Checked in Nemo Smoke Tests to doc tree.

	* docs/smoketests.html

2000-09-06  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1960 (nemo_strdup_strftime relies on glibc strftime
	behavior) and bug 2820 (date/time formatting uses non-standard
	glibc extension).

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-glib-extensions.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-glib-extensions.c:
	(nemo_strdup_strftime): Rewrote nemo_strdup_strftime so
	that it provides the features we need, but no longer requires the
	GNU glibc version of strftime.
	(nemo_g_string_append_len): Added a half-assed version of the
	GLib 2.0 function g_string_append_len, since I needed it for
	nemo_strdup_strftime.
	(test_strftime), (nemo_self_check_glib_extensions): Added
	light self-checks for the nemo_strdup_strftime function to
	confirm that my rewrite didn't break it.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_get_date_as_string): Refined the comments for
	localizers to make it clear that the GNU "%-" and "%_" extensions
	are allowed, but other GNU extensions are not.

	* components/services/trilobite/libtrilobite/.cvsignore:
	Ignore some generated files that weren't in the list.
	
2000-09-06  Arlo Rose  <arlo@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2644, Enter and Return should invoke file renaming.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-container.c:
	(key_press_event):

2000-09-06  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Added checks in Nemo to guarantee we will notice leaks
	of UI handlers in the future.

	The check will fire unless you get new Bonobo, since I just fixed
	a UI handler leak bug in Bonobo.

	* src/nemo-window.c: (nemo_window_real_set_content_view):
	Added code to check for a still-merged Open menu item in the file
	menu. This will catch leaks of UI handlers fairly quickly, instead
	of the traditional way we discover them, after long debugging
	sessions.

	* components/history/nemo-history-view.c:
	(history_view_frame_call_end):

	* components/services/time/nemo-view/trilobite-eazel-time-view.c:
	Remove a bunch of code inside #if 0, which had out of date copies
	of the sample code. I decided this was better than trying to fix
	it.
	
2000-09-06  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 2377 (Menu separators in search date criterion
	look wrong and are selectable)

	"" when defining menu item text.
	(nemo_search_bar_criterion_new_from_values): When
	constructing option menu items, treat empty string specially
	by not translating it and making an insensitive separator.

2000-09-06  Eskil Heyn Olsen  <eskil@eazel.com>

	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-metadata.c:

	Changed to call parents finalize
	(eazel_install_alter_mode_on_temp),

	Calls to chmod all the downloaded files and the tmpdir.
	(eazel_install_delete_downloads),
	(eazel_install_install_packages):
	Moved the deletion of downloads to a seperate call, so revert can
	also reap it's benefits.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-protocols.c:
	(gnome_vfs_xfer_callback), (eazel_install_fetch_file),
	Fixed download progress emission to only emit with amount==0 once
	for gnome-vfs downloads.
	Also checks for existence of package prior to download. This
	should be safe once md5 checking is done, and prevents
	fetch_dependencies from fetching the same file over and over
	(which maybe should be solver in another way).
	(eazel_install_fetch_package),
	Moved the md5 checking code into eazel_install_start_transaction.
	(eazel_install_fetch_package_which_provides),
	Fixed evil bug I found now that i modified rpmsearch.cgi to
	support ?provides= searches.
	(get_url_for_package):
	Fixed a packagedata_destroy_foreach call.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-public.h:
	Prototypes for the calls to chmod unchmod tmpdir + downloads.

	(eazel_install_monitor_subcommand_pipe),
	(eazel_install_do_transaction_md5_check),	
	(eazel_install_start_transaction),

	(eazel_install_fetch_rpm_dependencies),
	Do a check so the some packages isn't added several times.

	about the order of rpm's as we were led to believe.
	
	* components/services/install/lib/eazel-install-rpm-glue.h:
	Removed the EAZEL_INSTALL_DOWNLOADS status flag, check the

2000-09-05  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Much context-menu-related cleanup and some bug fixes.

	2734: comment fm_directory_view_add_context_menu_item

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gtk-extensions.h,
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-gtk-extensions.c:
	(nemo_gtk_menu_append_separator): New convenience function
	for appending a separator to a GtkMenu.
	(nemo_gtk_menu_set_item_visibility): New convenience function
	for hiding/showing a menu item in a GtkMenu.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.h:
	Removed overridable function pointers for 
	create_background_context_menu_zoom_items and
	create_background_context_menu_background_items; I made sure the
	API supports what these were used for in a more general way.
	Added overridable function pointer for supports_zooming. Now the
	base class handles disabling/removing things for subclasses that
	don't support zooming.
	Changed fm_directory_view_add_context_menu_item to
	_insert_context_menu_item and gave it a position parameter.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_initialize_class): removed function pointer
	assignment for deleted calls; added function pointer assignment
	for new supports_zooming call.
	(select_all_callback): Removed this function because I removed
	the item from the context menu (as per bug 1794).
	(fm_directory_view_bump_zoom_level),
	(fm_directory_view_zoom_to_level),
	(fm_directory_view_set_zoom_level),
	(fm_directory_view_restore_default_zoom_level),
	(fm_directory_view_can_zoom_in), (fm_directory_view_can_zoom_out):
	Bail out without calling overridable function pointer for these
	calls if supports_zooming is FALSE.
	(finish_inserting_menu_item): New function, generalization of
	finish_appending_menu_item that takes a position.
	(finish_appending_menu_item): Now calls finish_inserting_menu_item.
	Also, renamed this from finish_adding_menu_item.
	(compute_menu_item_info): Removed ellipsis from "Show Properties"
	and added comment explaining why it needs no ellipsis.
	(append_gtk_menu_item_with_view),
	(append_selection_menu_subtree): Update for adding -> appending rename.
	(fm_directory_view_insert_context_menu_item): Generalization of
	_append_context_menu_item that takes a position parameter.
	(fm_directory_view_append_context_menu_item): Renamed from
	_add_context_menu_item, and now calls _insert_context_menu_item.
	(real_create_background_context_menu_zoom_items),
	(real_create_background_context_menu_background_items):
	Removed these functions. These menu items are no longer treated as
	special cases.
	(fm_directory_view_real_create_background_context_menu_items):
	Now inserts zooming items only if supports_zooming is TRUE;
	resurrected the accidentally-obliterated "Reset Background" item.
	(add_separator): Removed this function in favor of 
	nemo_gtk_menu_append_separator.
	(add_application_to_gtk_menu), (add_component_to_gtk_menu),
	(create_open_with_gtk_menu),
	Update for API renames.
	(fm_directory_view_real_create_selection_context_menu_items):
	Use nemo_gtk_menu_append_separator.
	(fm_directory_view_supports_zooming): New function, calls 
	virtual function.
	(fm_directory_view_real_supports_zooming): New function,
	returns TRUE.

	* src/file-manager/fm-icon-view.c:
	(fm_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_items):
	Remove "Icon Captions..." item per bug 1794

	* src/file-manager/fm-desktop-icon-view.c:
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_zoom_items),
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_background_items),
	(bump_zoom_level), (zoom_to_level), (restore_default_zoom_level),
	(can_zoom_in), (can_zoom_out): Removed these functions due to
	reworking the responsibilities of super- and subclass.
	(real_supports_zooming): New function, returns FALSE.	
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_initialize_class): Remove overrides of various
	functions; add override for supports_zooming.
	(new_folder_menu_item_callback): Removed this now that it inherits
	New Folder from parent.
	(fm_desktop_icon_view_create_background_context_menu_items):
	Cleaned this up to start with inherited and make modifications
	as necessary rather than reimplementing the whole thing.

	* check-FIXME.pl: Removed some special-case file names
	that aren't needed any more.

	(get_link_name): Added comments to help localizers.
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-file.c:
	(nemo_file_get_date_as_string): Added comments to help

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-icon-canvas-item.c:
	(draw_or_measure_label_text): Added a comment to help localizers.
	* src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c:
	(fm_directory_view_display_selection_info): Unmarked one string
	that doesn't make sense to translate and adding a comment to
	another to explain why it is marked for translation.
	(add_separator): Changed add_open_with_gtk_menu_item into this
	function, which deals with bug 2735 (add_open_with_gtk_menu_item
	only called to create separator?).
	(create_open_with_gtk_menu): Call the new add_separator function.
	* src/nemo-zoom-control.c: (create_zoom_menu_item): Added a
	comment to help localizers.
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-link.c: (make_local_path): Fixed
	logic here that was doing strange things with URIs.  This deals
	with bugs 2492 (Incorrect unescaping when dealing with link
	files), 2493 (Mysterious and probably incorrect "+7" when escaping
	URI for link file), and 2737 (link code must make path into URI).
	
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-search-bar-criterion.c:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-search-bar-criterion.h:
	* po/POTFILES.in:
	Removed these duplicate files. Rebecca moved them to src, but she
	didn't remove the old ones. I didn't have to remove them from the
	makefile, since they were already removed, but I had to remove
	them from the list of files to translate.
	
	* src/nemo-search-bar-criterion.h:
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-search-uri.h:
	Moved some of the stuff from nemo-search-bar-criterion.h to
	here, since it's really about search URIs, not specific to the
	search bar. Over time we will move more.
	
	* src/nemo-search-bar-criterion.c: Added include of the
	nemo-search-uri.h header now that stuff was moved there.
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	Fixed includes to get the nemo-search-bar-criterion.h from its
	new location. This is not a real solution to the problem that was
	exposed by moving the search bar code. The bug 2815 covers this.
	* src/nemo-complex-search-bar.c: Fix search bar so it gets
	the real location of the header. It was including the old one.
	* src/nemo-simple-search-bar.c: Fix search bar so it gets
	the real location of the header. It was including the old one.

	* src/nemo-main.c: (main): Some small cleanups including some
	additional parameter checking and returning a failure code to
	the invoking shell in the case where the parameters are not
	consistent.

	to switch to Intermediate and let you edit those
	settings.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-user-level-manager.c,
	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-user-level-manager.h:
	Made the #defines for the user level ints public, so

	(user_level_customize_callback): If the current user level is

        (sect_footer): Renamed the variables to be more descriptive. Modified
        calls to print_footer (function changed + we now pass the full URI).
        Fixed memory leaks by actually freeing the variables.
        (print_footer): Change the function arguments to make it a 'sane'
        function. Also - just print what we recieve.

        'included' with the sect1 tags.

        Ideally we should create anchor tags in the sect1 'pages' and use that
        instead, but this will not work due to mozilla issues

	the debugger on warnings.

2000-09-01  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Changed all nemo dialog calls to take a window title
	(or NULL to get "Nemo: Error" and the like). Updated 
	all callers to pass a window title.

2000-09-01  Michael Engber  <engber@eazel.com>
	
	Removed our quitting logic from nemo-application
	(where it was tied to nemo-window closing) and added
	a more general mechanism in main.c - by which you can
	register any gtk object to keep the main event loop
	alive while the object is around. This, in turn, fixed 
	a problem with the first-time-druid not causing nemo
	to quit when it was cancel via the close box (bug 2211)
	and also a problem with nemo quitting before you had
	a chance to see an error dialog (bug 1871). Also, added
	nemo_main_event_loop_quit as the preferred way to
	cause nemo to quit (as opposed to gtk_main_quit)

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-glib-extensions.c:
	(print_key_string), (free_hash_tables_at_exit),
	(nemo_g_hash_table_new_free_at_exit): Added code to print out
	the keys for the hash table at exit time if it's a hash table with
	string keys. I can tell the keys are strings because the hash
	function is g_str_hash.
	
	* src/file-manager/nemo-trash-monitor.c:
	(nemo_trash_monitor_initialize): Used connect_while_alive

2000-09-01  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 1476 (Using bogus local bookmark should update
	its icon). The specific bug led me to changing some of
	the internals of NemoBookmark in a way that has nice
	UI consequences. Now if you use Nemo to move a bookmarked
	file, the bookmark will continue to find the moved file, and
	if you delete a file, the bookmark's icon will change to the
	"missing location" icon.

	* libnemo-extensions/nemo-bookmark.c:
	(nemo_bookmark_disconnect_file),
	(nemo_bookmark_connect_file): New helper functions that
	handle wiring or unwiring the connection between a bookmark
	and its NemoFile.
	(nemo_bookmark_destroy): Use nemo_bookmark_disconnect_file.
	(nemo_bookmark_new_with_icon): Use nemo_bookmark_connect_file.
	(bookmark_file_changed_callback): Notice changes in the file's URI
	and update the bookmark to use the new URI; notice when the file
	is gone and disconnect/reconnect to file.

	Miscellaneous tweaks:
	
	* src/file-manager/fm-search-list-view.c:
	(compute_reveal_item_name_and_sensitivity): At the suggestion of
	a localizer (menthos), added explanatory comments before the use
	of "Reveal in New Window" and "Reveal in <n> New Windows". It turns
	out that a comment just before a translatable text string will
	appear in the .pot files that localizers use.
	* src/nemo-first-time-druid.c: (set_up_user_level_page):
	Fixed two misspellings of "technical" and one missing period. Thanks
	to menthos for pointing these out.
	* src/nemo-window-menus.c: 
	(show_bogus_bookmark_window): Use nemo_format_uri_for_display
	for bookmark uris shown in user messages. Simplify the message you
	get if you choose a known-bogus URI from the Go menu.

2000-09-01  Gene Z. Ragan  <gzr@eazel.com>

2000-09-01  Pavel Cisler  <pavel@eazel.com>

	Fix bugzilla 2186 - Move/Copy/Make-Link for times from multiple directories
	fails. Still needs more testing.
	Reworked file operations to match new gnome_vfs_xfer... APIs that now take
	lists of URIs for copy source and destination.
